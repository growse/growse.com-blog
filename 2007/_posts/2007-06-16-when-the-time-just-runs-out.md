title: "When the time just runs out"

I've been slightly busy this month, hence lack of updates. I'm doing a show 5
nights a week and this leaves little time to do anything else. This particular
show happens to be:

[The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas][1] which is on at [The Landor
Theatre][2] which is in [Clapham][3]. We're running until the end of the
month, so turn up to that! If you need a reason, then scantily clad dancing
girls should be good enough. If you need more reasons, then this really isn't
your show. Don't turn up on a Sunday or Monday though, it's not happening
then.

I've been working on my latest project, Grawgle which should make my
photo galleries look better. However, lack of time means I'm stuck on v0.2 at
the moment. Hopefully 0.3 will bring more improvements.
