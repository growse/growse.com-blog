I just had a phone call from a person over at [Singlepoint][1] about my little
problem and shockingly, they've agreed to give me money back. I think it might
have had something to do with me being politly finger-pointy and also sending
the letter via registered post and on nice thick paper with a college
letterhead. I think I might put "Getting money out of a phone company" down in
my list of things to be done before I'm 35, just after "Get a job" and before
"Win the lottery".And something blue arrived in the post. Pretty :)
