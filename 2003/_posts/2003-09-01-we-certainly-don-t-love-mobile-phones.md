I went to the proms. Again. However, I turned up at a relatively late 2:30pm
and subsequently the queue was already all the way down the road (quite a
popular concert). Managed to get about 25th in the gallery queue so it wasn't
all bad. At least it didn't rain.Saw the Rite along with a few other things
and for those millions of you who I know were listening eagerly to the concert
on [Radio 3][1] will have heard the idiot's mobile phone echoing around the
hall in the middle of the first bar. Sensibly, they started again.I also made
an important discovery today - I need more money. But at least this time in
two days I'll be in Spain :-)
