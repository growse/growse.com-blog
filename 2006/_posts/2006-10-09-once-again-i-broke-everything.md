title: "Once again, I broke everything!"
---
About a week ago, I broke the admin side of this site. I couldn't be bothered
to fix it, as I'm moving host soon to a dedicated box. In theory,
[Register1][1] were meant to have the new box in place and running already,
but 'supply issues' have meant that it's not there yet. Therefore I thought a
post was in order to keep me up to date with what's going on. I shall now flop
out everything that's in my head in no discernible order.

I bought the monitor!!! It's rather huge. It's also rather awesome. I was
going to order it from the cheapest place on [Froogle][2], but they turned out
to be crap, so i had to get it from somewhere about $20 more expensive. Still,
it turned up, perfect condition, no dead pixels etc. The only thing it doesn't
do (apparently) is accept HD input. I don't care about this really, I don't
watch anything in HD. Now I just have to find a way to get rid of my old
monitor. I'll probably have to sell it here, via ebay - really don't want to
have to post it though.

[This][3] is amazingly cool. Good to watch when drunk.

I'm coming back to the UK! Just for a week though starting October 16th. Back
for good on December 17th.

I'm perplexed by the weather here. It's lunchtime right now, on a monday in
October and it's about 22 degrees outside. I don't understand what's going on
- I was expecting drizzle, winds, trees flapping about, odd-coloured leaves
flying through the streets and all that stuff you get from a New England Fall.
Must happen later.

I wasted an hour of my life the other night trying to put a SCSI cage together
sideways. I was so amazingly pissed off that I had possibly got something that
was stupid and proprietry that I missed the fact that it wasn't the right way
up. For an hour. Joy.

I had an idea that I could review every single [Ben & Jerry's][4] flavour that
I could buy in my local shop (quite a lot of them), but then I decided I would
get amazingly large amazingly quickly. So I binned that idea.

I'm out of things to say. Nothing's happening at work, things are slowly
progressing on the [PSPlant][5] front but we can't do much until the new host
is up and I have no cake. Must buy some cake.
