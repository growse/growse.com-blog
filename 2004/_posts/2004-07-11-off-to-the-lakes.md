title: "Off to the lakes"
---
Off to the Lake District at some point this week. I decided I needed a
holiday, and the opportunity for one arose. Not been to the lakes in a long
long time, so I'm quite looking forward to seeing what climbing (and
descending) lots of hills is like. Add to that the fact that the area is
insanely pretty, and it'll probably rain lots, and you get a fun filled time
:)

In other news, a bank was recently spotted giving me money. It is with this
that I have bought my latest "toy": The DI box.

Hurrah!!
