title: "I killed Christmas"
---
Well, December is here. The eagle-eyed amongst you will have noticed that this
year I'm not bothering with snow, Christmas trees or silly falling snow, I'm
keeping it simple.

There's a number of reasons for this, but the main one is that I haven't
really got enough time to play around with such things. I've been doing all
sorts of important other stuff, like playing around with [Minify!!!][1]. It's
a neat little thing that squishes CSS and Javascript down into a single
minimized request. Rather neat.

The rest of my time is spent looking at lots of pieces of paper, writing lots
of words and counting down the time until the holidays start. After that,
someone else will have to look at the paper and write the words.
