Well, I went and did it. I've released an initial version of Feedling - all
details can be found at [the homepage][1].

On a separate note, [Sourceforge][2] is fantastic. Hosted SVN / CVS, access to
a shell server, web hosting, forums, bug / feature tracking, release
management, and all completely free. Fabulous.
