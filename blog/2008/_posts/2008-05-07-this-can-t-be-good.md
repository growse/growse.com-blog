title: "This can't be good"

I'm still ill. It's been over two weeks now and I've gone through the entire
spectrum of really really annoying symptoms. I've no clue what's going on.

I've just booked a holiday to the Maldives. This is rather exciting as I've
not been on a proper beachy holiday for over 4 years now. I'm apparently
staying in a "beach bungalow" which differs from a "water bungalow" in that
it's on the beach and not in the water. Sensible move I think. In the
meantime, I have 4 weeks to look forward to beachyness and have to instead
figure out a word that almost means "integrity", but not quite.

Hopefully I'll be better in a month. If I'm not, I want my money back.
