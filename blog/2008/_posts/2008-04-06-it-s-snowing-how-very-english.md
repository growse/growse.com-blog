title: "It's snowing. How very English"

So I'm trying to get to Dublin, and this requires me to get up at 6 to catch a
10am flight from Gatwick. It's technically spring now, so I'm currently
looking out the window at a bunch of planes all covered in snow. There's big
chunks of the stuff floating down from the sky as well.

What's more worrying is that none of the planes actually seem to be going
anywhere. At least they've got a limitless supply of coke and chocolate
cookies here :)
