Someone sent me this today. It's a new concept for interacting with computer
desktops modelled on how a real desk behaves. Watch [the video][1] and then
visit [the site][2]. It claims to be in a private beta, so hopefully it'll be
available to try out soon.

I'd be interested to see how it works, as the guy is talking about moving away
from a point-click type of interface. Creating new stuff is fine, but how that
works when the main user interface device is fundamentally a pointy-clicky
thing is yet to be seen. Maybe it's aimed at the supposedly upcoming [touch-
based interfaces][3]...
