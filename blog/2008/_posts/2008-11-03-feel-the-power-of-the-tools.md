title: "Feel the power! Of the tools!"
---
Over the past few days, I've been mostly amusing myself with power tools.
Historically, I've been very bad at anything involving physical construction
and therefore approached the large drill and shelf brackets with some
trepidation. However, once I got into the hang of drawing lines in the wrong
place followed by drilling holes in the wrong place, I found that DIY is a
great way to concentrate the mind on a particular task whilst only causing
minor damage to interior walls and almost no injury.

I envisage a bright and sparkly future punctuated with regular purchases of
increasingly powerful shiny things interspersed with periods of installing
unnecessary storage equipment. Maybe one day I'll own a buzz saw.
