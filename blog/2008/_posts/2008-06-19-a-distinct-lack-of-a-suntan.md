title: "A distinct lack of a suntan"
---
I had a good time. I really did. I spent most of the last week lounging by the
pool, and when I wasn't lounging by the pool, I was lounging by the beach.
Occasionally I would sleep or eat, but this didn't happen very often.

Actually, I lie - I went snorkelling and parasailing and both of these things
were amazing. I think I will go again next year, but I'm worried about the
large student loans statement I just received in the post. I need to phone
them up and shout at them for not taking money from me over the past 3 years
through PAYE. Muppets. Then there's the huge skiing holiday that I want, along
with the big house and eventually I start to realise that it might be 4 years
until I have another holiday. Oh well.
