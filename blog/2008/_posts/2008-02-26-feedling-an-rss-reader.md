title: "Feedling: An RSS Reader"
---
I got bored t'other day, and I wrote an RSS reader (I think this is the second
one I've written now) that sits on the desktop and stays out of the way. I've
decided to stick it on sourceforge and call it Feedling - I'll stick a bit
about it in the projects bit as soon as it gets approved from the sourceforge
overlords :)
