title: "Running VMware ESXi 4.1 on an HP ML110/115?"

Here's a handy hint to those who have an HP ML110 or ML115 running VMware
vSphere ESXi 4.1. If you're thinking about installing the HP CIM agents in
order to get some more interesting information out of the thing, don't.

The phrase 'world of pain' is appropriate here.

If you do, you'll be wanting to read [http://www.techhead.co.uk/vmware-esxi-
purple-screen-of-death-on-hp-proliant-ml110-or-ml115][1] and

your stupid predicament.
