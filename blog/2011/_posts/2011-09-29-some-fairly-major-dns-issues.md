title: "Some fairly major DNS issues"
---
I've been having some problems with DNS recently which have caused a few blips in this site and (arguably more importantly) my email. Turns out that my secondary DNS providers had stopped replicating from my primary nameserver, and then gave up serving records entirely. The fact that this has all happened just as I've decided to travel to Morocco, a country not exactly famed for its connectivity possibilities, means solving it has been a tad tricky.

Should all be fixed now, was a combination of the DNS provider being slow and my being stupid. Still, makes me question whether hosting my own primary DNS is something I want to really be doing...

PS: If Morocco is this hot in late September, I dread to think what it's like in the actual hot season.
