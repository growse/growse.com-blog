title: "Feedling. Something to do with git."
---
I've gone and released [version 0.8][1] of [Feedling][2]. Seems like a silly
thing to do, but apparently some people were actually using it and reporting
some bugs, so I thought I had some sort of moral responsibility to keep them
happy blah blah blah. There's some random stupid bugs fixed and some features
added, like an auto-updater and the ability to change how many headlines per
feed you want. Next up will probably be some sort of Google reader
integration, but we'll see how that one goes.

I've moved the code over to [Github][3] for a couple of reasons: 1) it's
popular and 2) git is awesome. I've still to figure out how to do some of the
things with the service that I want to, but I like its simplicity so far.
Highly recommended.
