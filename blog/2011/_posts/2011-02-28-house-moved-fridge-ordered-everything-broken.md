I hate packing. Thankfully, I don't do it that often. I had to do it to move
house last weekend though, and through the frustration, I'm comforted by the
fact that I won't have to do it again for a long, long time. I'm living
somewhere different now, and this is somewhere that could reasonably be
described 'in the countryside'. Farmers may scoff, but compared to London this
is bumpkin-bliss.

Unfortunately, my near future is filled with various activities involving
fixing things (the plumbing appears to be quite 'delicate'), arguing with
various government agencies and companies about where I live and building
things out of wood.

I have to mention BT. I'm using [Andrews and Arnold][1] as an ISP, and they're
beyond brilliant. Not cheap, but you get what you pay for. At the moment, I've
got a regular but intermittent fault on the phone line which means internet
goes down about 6 times a day for about 10 minutes. Naturally, BT are blaming
everyone else, which makes a nice change. Still, I'm looking forward to the
day everything just magically works again. Can't be long now.
