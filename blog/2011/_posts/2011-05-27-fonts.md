Some amazing fonts listed [on this guy's page][1].

I find fonts fascinating, mostly because it's a creative work I have
absolutely no clue how it happens. Most other things, I can try and
understand. Such as music, drawings, sculptures etc - whilst I might not be
able to do half of those things, I can at least vaguely relate to the creative
processes that go into making works in those fields.

Fonts, I've no idea. And yet they can be so beautiful. Thankfully, The Blonde
One (TBO) has bought me a copy of [Just My Type: A Book About Fonts][2] so I
can try to actually learn something about this amazing medium. I just feel
slightly bad I got it for Christmas and haven't even really looked at it yet.
Will go and read it now.
