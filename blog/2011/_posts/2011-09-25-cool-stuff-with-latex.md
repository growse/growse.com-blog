title: "Cool stuff with LaTeX"
---
I'm a massive fan of [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/). It's so good at doing a particular task very well, and the fact it's been around as long as I have means that it's had plenty of time to build up a following of dedicated geeks.

The principal benefits of this are enjoying silly things like [this](http://hanno-rein.de/archives/349). Brilliant.
