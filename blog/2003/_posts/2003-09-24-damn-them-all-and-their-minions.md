Back in Cambridge now, and I've just been told that the people in white coats
are about to remove my 3-piece suite from my room. Bastards. If they take my
desk or table from me, I'm not going to be happy. I like that sofa.

Anyway, the organ scholarship trials start today. Which means about 35
temperamental adolescent organists are descending on Cambridge. Great.
