title: "April 1st? Again?"

Well, I got out of bed after midday, and then couldn't be bothered to do
anything, so the sum total of my effort towards the global phenomenon that is
April Fool's day is this:

Flah.

I feel much better already now. The only thing to do now, is go shopping for
things I don't need.
