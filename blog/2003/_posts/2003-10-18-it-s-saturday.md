title: "It's Saturday!!!"

Well, hurrah for chips. The end of the week is usually both a bad and a good
thing. Good because of no lectures and brunch, bad because of the hideous
amounts of work + other random stuff I have to do. At least it's purple.Turns
out that the magical mystical place called [Tonbridge School][1] are planning
on sending me a cheque, as they do at this point every year so far. It's
always nice to find that you've got an extra £100 which you never budgeted
for. However, it turns out that my bill was £100 more than expected, because
the rent rebates havn't kicked in yet. So overall, as usual, no gain at all.I
do hope them that be at Warwick will be pleased with this database....
