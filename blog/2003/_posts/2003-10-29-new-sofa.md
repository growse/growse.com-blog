title: "New sofa!!!!!!"
---
Hurrah! After much umming and erring, college finally got round to delivering
me a new sofa. Well, I say "new", by which I mean I've not seen it before and
it's never been in this room before. What I actually mean is that it's
probably about 349 years old, and has lots of interesting wildlife hiding in
it. It's rather comfy, but quite unattractive. Not that I rate the
attractiveness of every sofa I see.Right, I really need to stop waffling and
go and find some food. After that, I need to go and shop. And then I need to
work. And somewhere along the line I need to put various things in the post to
various people, and pay various cheques in. And I'm doing a practical all at
the same time. And a person called [Tristan][1] tells me he's coming to
Cambridge over the weekend. I've never met him, and I'm never sure if he's
telling the truth or not. I'm sure I'll find out soon enough.
