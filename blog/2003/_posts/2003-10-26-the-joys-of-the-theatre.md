title: "The joys of the theatre"

I managed to go and see [The Reduced Shakespeare Company][1] who were on at
the Corn Exchange doing "All the great books". To say it was slightly funny is
like saying that the pacific is slightly deep. I've never seen them do
anything before, but I thoroughly recommend them to anyone who has the
opportunity :)To add to that, I was in a theatre all day yesterday (doing a
tech) and will be for bits of this week. Hurrah!That, and I've got far too
much work to do.
