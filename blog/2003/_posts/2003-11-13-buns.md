At a complete surprise to myself and the penguins in the Antarctic, I was
delivered a Chelsea Bun purchased from Fitzbillies down the road. Now,
apparently these are world-famous, although I must admit I didn't know what a
Chelsea Bun was before I encountered this particularly good bit of cake. How
it is possible to fit so much sugar into 8 cubic inches worth of bun and still
make it absolutely lovely is something that defies belief. I just hope they're
not hideously expensive so that I can go and buy lots more :)I'm going to be
on a sugar high for the rest of the decade now.....
