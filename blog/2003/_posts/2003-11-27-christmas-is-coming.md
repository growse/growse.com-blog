title: "Christmas is coming"

Well, having a bored half hour, I decided to set up the christmas theme for
the site for this year, which should become active midnight 1st December.
Should.Also, I'm halfway through the play run that I'm doing at the moment.
This can only mean that we're having a halfway through run party tonight. It's
worth pointing out that we only run for 5 nights, we had a first night party,
we will have a last night party, and we're having one tonight.
Hmmmmmmmmmmm..... By party I actually mean we'll go out and find lots of
alcohol and chocolate and procede to drink/eat the lot. :)

Oh the joys.
