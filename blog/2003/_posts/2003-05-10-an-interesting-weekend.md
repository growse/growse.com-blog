Last night was the annual Pembroke College Choir Dinner. This is an event that
occurs every year where the College decide to give the choir (and me) a nice
posh 4 course meal with lots and lots of alcohol. There follows a certain
amount of entertainment followed by more alcohol. This normally goes on until
some early time in the morning. When I got up (just now - yes it's half
one...) I found that I had gained 4 port glasses, a port decanter, a college
coffee cup and saucer, a white wine glass and a guitar. I will be returning
these (of course) whenever anyone asks for them ;)

And then tonight, I have to work all through the night doing a get-in at the
ADC (local amateur theatre) follows by one of the most important college
occasions in chapel and then I go to another party on a boat. I'm blatantly
not going to get much sleep.
