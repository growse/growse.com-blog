title: "We really really love the railways"
---
I'm now in Warwick. Apparently I have to build a database/web/thingie server
which I've called squeeble. I would be a lot happier, but I left my phone on
the train and therefore my phone is currently in Newcastle. This would have
been ok had I been able to get through to the station to tell them that my
phone was arriving on the 20:23 from somewhere, but due to the absolutely
wonderful system that runs our railways, it was impossible to get through to
anyone. Besides, I've only 2 months left on the contract anyway and so it'll
cost me £30 max. And it's an excuse to get a different better phone on a
better tarrif with a company that doesn't strive to make as much money out of
everyone as possible.

So if anyone's reading this and can't get through to me, I don't actually have
a phone. At all. You'll want to phone college.

Now I need to go and buy a new phone.
