Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

Leave on holiday in an hour and a half.

Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

I think it's important to point this out often.

:)

I'm desparately trying to source a camera after my usual contacts failed me. I
might have to buy a cheap one when I'm there or something seeing as no-one
else is prepared to buy me one :(

Happy New Year to everyone. (Unless I find an intarweb place in the US, in
which case I'll say that then).

(Too many damn smileys)
