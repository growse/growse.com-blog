title: "I have no idea what's going on right now"

Lectures start in 2 days, and unlike last year where I had a simple timetable
which stayed the same from week to week, this one changes every week.
Therefore it will simply be a case of turning up at 9am every day simply not
knowing what course the lecture will be on. At least it will add an air of
excitment to life - a thing lacking ever since.... well, ever since I can
remember.Apparently I have a practical every day. I'm sure that's not right,
but I really can't be bothered to wade through all the crap I've been given
telling me when my practicals for the first 5 weeks are.Cambridge life(tm).
There's nothing quite like it.P.S. The BBC want to talk to me about my
involvement in the Cambridge University SETI project. W00tage.
