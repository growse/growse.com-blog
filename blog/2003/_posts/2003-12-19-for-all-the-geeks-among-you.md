<geek>First I built this database thing (that I keep talking about). It was
basically an access thing sat on a slowish webserver and it was talked to by a
bunch of asp scripts. This was fine when there was 3 records in the database
and one person was using it. However, it's now got around 280,000 records and
about 5 people using it. So we talked to some very nice people who moved the
entire thing onto a SQL server. A rather quick and expensive SQL server (think
quad xeon with 2.5Gb memory)</geek>

For all you normal people out there, today might be my last day. Hurray! And
I'm going on holiday in a week. Hurray! And it's Christmas day on Thursday.
Hurray! And I need to by people things. Crap....
