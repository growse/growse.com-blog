This is bad. This is really bad. You go on holiday to somewhere that's famed
for snowing in winter, and it isn't snowing. Honestly.

But Hurrah! as it's New Years Eve today. So hopefully at about 6pm (this time)
I'll be crammed into Times Square and not let out again until about 1am. My
main provisions will be lots of cake, so all in all, it should be quite good
fun.Woo, too many commas.
