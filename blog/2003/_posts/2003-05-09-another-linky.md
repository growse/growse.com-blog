And......

If I were a Springer-Verlag Graduate Text in Mathematics, I would be Serge
Lang's **_Algebraic Number Theory_**.

I cover all of the basic material of classical algebraic number theory, giving
the student the background necessary for the study of further topics in
algebraic number theory, such as cyclotomic fields, or modular forms. Part I
introduces some of the basic ideas of the theory: number fields, ideal
classes, ideles and adeles, and zeta functions. It also contains a version of
a Riemann-Roch theorem in number fields, proved by Lang in the very first
version of the book in the sixties. This version can now be seen as a
precursor of Arakelov theory. Part II covers class field theory, and Part III
is devoted to analytic methods, including an exposition of Tate's thesis, the
Brauer-Siegel theorem, and Weil's explicit formulas. This new edition of me
contains corrections, as well as several additions to the previous edition,
and the last chapter on explicit formulas has been rewritten.
