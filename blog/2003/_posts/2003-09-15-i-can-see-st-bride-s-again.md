It seems that my plan to just turn up to the office in London and hope that
they might find a use for me worked. They all seem fairly pleased. I may even
make a profit on this week.In Cambridge next Sunday, thankfully, although I'll
be in Leamington for bits of that. Then the joy of the thing that is the organ
