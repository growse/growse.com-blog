I'm back in cambridge tomorrow, which means I don't have to sit and wait
forever for pages to load. mmmmmmmmmmm 10Mbit :)

Got [ICQ][1] working for my [phone][2] which means I can now sit in fields and
say 'hi' to people for free. But that's kinda the point of a phone in the
first place so I'm not sure if I've got one up on moral society there or not.
Ah well.

I had my third steak of the week today after deciding to hack round the
countryside on my bike, but it's comforting to know that my diet will most
likely get worse at cambridge (it always does). That said, it is now certain
that I will be going to Barcelona for my holiday in September. Did I say
holiday? I meant extremely stressful and hardworking choir tour :p
