title: "What a delightful day"

Today was another one of those days which took an unexpected turn at every
opportunity. I went punting with Ruth and Tiffany at which point they proceeded to drag me around various shops in Cambridge for the afternoon, although that did give me the opportunity to buy [this][3] which I've just finished listening to and is fab.

New phone arrives tomorrow - I'm not sure I can take the excitement.
