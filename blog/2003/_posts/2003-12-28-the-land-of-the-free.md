It's 5:30 in the morning local time, and I'm sat here in a hostel because
there's no point sleeping. Usefully, the 8:30 flight out ended up leaving at
about midnight, and therefore I arrived at 3:30 local to find that there
wasn't a bus for 2 hours. Therefore, I got a taxi to the wrong hostel (even
longer story) and ended up asking the person at this wrong hostel if I could
sit in a chair for 3 hours. Thankfully, he said yes.

I've now been up over 24 hours, and I won't sleep for another 15 hours at
least. Great!
