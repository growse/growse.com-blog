title: "Sunny :-)"

Well, I'm bored again, so I thought another news post would be good. This
morning I conducted the lovely [Pembroke Choir][1] at Gt. St. Mary's (big
church in the middle of Cambridge) because today of all sunny days we had to
sing at the University Sermon. This apparently is a great phenomenon that
occurs about twice a term and consists of someone talking a lot and a bit of
singing at the end. This time, the talking went on for about 23.5 minutes
meaning that I didn't quite fall asleep.

I'm not sure why or how that was relevant, but I'm now going to go and frollic
in the sunshine :)
