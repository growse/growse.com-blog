This is fairly funky. I'm sat in the Chemistry library again (I'm making
E,E-1,4-Diphenyl-1,3-butadiene this week), but instead of making a diary entry
from the computer here, I'm doing it from the computer in my room.
Magic!!!!!!I'm only here because I have to wait an hour for something to
bubble lots, and whilst that's happening, I might as well finish writing up my
last practical, but the file's on my computer in my room, and I couldn't be
arsed to go back and get it, hence the Magic!!!!!!! bit.I also really need to
go and get my university card back off Scudamore's - they've had it for about
3-4 months now after I left it with them when I went punting in the Summer.
Without it, I can't get into this library, so have to stand outside the door
looking a bit silly until someone else goes in or comes out. Ah well.I think I
had better go before my reaction explodes.
