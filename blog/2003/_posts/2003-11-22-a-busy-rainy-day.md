title: "A busy rainy day"

I spent most of today in a theatre. What I wasn't spending in a theatre I was
in a taxi to and from the stage hire place in the rain, or I was spending
about Â£100 hiring and buying stuff. I really hope I get that back, otherwise I
might be a bit annoyed.Still, we had a tech today, which only lasted 8 hours
which has got to be an all time record. Music run-through tomorrow, dress
Monday, open Tuesday. Ouch.
