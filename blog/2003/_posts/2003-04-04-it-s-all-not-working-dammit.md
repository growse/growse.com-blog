title: "It's all not working dammit."

As I sit here listening to Paul Simon's _Graceland_ (fab album btw) and
contemplate what lifestyle dinner used to live whilst shouting repeatedly at a
Cabletron MicroMMac-24E in order to get it to talk to me, I pause to notice
how awful this carpet is, and how there's a kitchen behind me, in bits.

It was sunny today, and that's always good. It means I can go to that place
called "outside" and see what's happening there. I'm hoping it's sunny
tomorrow so I can possibly go to Hastings, and then on Sunday, when I'm off to
Windsor to sing in the Castle because that would mean that it's not raining
which, again, is a good thing.

Also, apparently, whilst trying to arrange a holiday, or tour, for 26 people
in September, my destination has moved from Seville, to Barcelona, then back
to Seville, then up to Barcelona again with a brief flickering in Belgium,
then France, and now it's back to Barcelona and it's looking at Malta in a
scary way. Dammit.

Mmmmmm. Chicken. Scary.
