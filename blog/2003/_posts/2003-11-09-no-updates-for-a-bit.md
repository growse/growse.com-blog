title: "No updates for a bit"

It's sunday. And I'm bored. Currently, I'm quite ill, and I've just conducted
the Mozart Requiem, which went leaps and bounds to improve my state of health.
Really.Add to that the fact I can't sleep because there are some people
cleaning college outside and they're being quite noisy about it. They were
being quite noisy about it at 7:00 this morning, and they're going to carry on
being noisy until about 4 this afternoon. The amount of work I will therefore
get done today is minute - nearly zero in fact.I've got this love affair with
the full stop.See.
