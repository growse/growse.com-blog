title: "It's Thursday Today. Apparently."
---
I've reached that point where I've done everything I need to or can do, and
now I'm just waiting on other people to do other things for me. I missed the
train this morning, mainly because I woke up at 7:38 and the train leaves at
7:36. Of course I didn't tell anyone that. I merely strolled in about 20
minutes late with the excuse that I stayed 20 minutes late yesterday. Time-
management, you just can't beat it.

There are now 9 things to be done. I've done 3, I can't do 2 yet, 1 of them
isn't going to get done because it's stupid, and the rest are someone else's
problem. And I've got 15 minutes before I decide that I want to go to lunch,
so I will pass the time by looking busy. Given the large ratio between the
time that it takes for me to do things and the time everyone else thinks it
takes me to do things, I'm getting rather good at looking busy. :-) Currently,
1$ is worth 56.56p. I know it's a record low, but dammit it needs to go even
lower. I just hope there isn't a surge in the market before I leave on
holiday...
