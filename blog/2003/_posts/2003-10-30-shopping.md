I really must keep reminding myself of why I hate Cambridge (the town) and
Cambridge (the public) so much. Actually, that's a bit harsh, it's only the
public that really really annoys me. It's almost as if to compensate for the
large influx of relativly bright students, the public get a lot thicker. They
will clearly do everything they can to block, impede, trip, annoy me as I walk
down the street. I gave up trying to go round them after about 5 mins and
spent the past hour gleefully walking through people. :-)And I've just
realised I forgot to go to the bank. Grrrrrrr.......
