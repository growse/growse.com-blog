title: "My Phone Bill"
---
It turns out that due to the rather large number of people I was phoning up /
emailing in the holidays, college owes me £152.06 for my phone bill. And
that's being lenient. We're planning to have a concert on Monday to raise
money "for the tour", but at this rate it's turning into raising money "to pay
my bills". Don't tell the choir that.
