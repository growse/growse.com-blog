I've magically transformed from "person who sleeps all the time" to "person
who can never sleep", the end result of which is me, at a quarter past two
feeling slightly bored and tired. I amused myself by listening to Reich (Six
Pianos; Drumming Music; Variations for Winds, Strings and Keyboards; etc.) Go
me.

Only 5 hours to kill until sunrise.
