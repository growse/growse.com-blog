Well, today I got up at 6am. Yes that's really early and it was still dark. I
had to get the 7am train to be in London by 9. Watching the sun rise whilst on
the train was pretty cool though :) And it's really very very very very very
cold outside. Lunch might be interesting. But then again, I do have over a
kilo of chocolate sat next to me. Technically, I'm working for the next 3
weeks, and then I depart for snowy places across the pond. I should buy some
gloves before then.
