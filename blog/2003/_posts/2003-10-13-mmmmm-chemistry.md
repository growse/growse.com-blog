title: "Mmmmm..... Chemistry"
---
I'd forgotten how nice the chemistry library actually is. I've got a whole
hour to burn since my 10am lecture isn't happening due to my lecture format,
which might as well be random for all the sense it makes. I think that after
this I will go and set myself alight whilst attempting to synthesize (make)
Bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron. Or something.I also need to get some practice in on
this whole sleep thing, it's not going so well at the moment. The fact that
large chunks of Pembroke College Chapel Choir (go them!) keep inviting
themselves back to my room to drink themselves silly whilst preventing me from
sleeping is, I think, a key contributor towards my lack of sleep problem. Ah
well. I could always try pulling off the trick of getting everyone to do
everything for me. It's nearly working so far....
