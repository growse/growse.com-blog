title: "Illness reigns supreme"

The joys of lying in bed doing nothing, and on occasion visiting the doctor
only to be told to return to bed, are some of the things I think that it's
worth writing about some day, waaaaay off in the future when I am no longer
ill, and have therefore got past the point of constructing excessivly long
sentances in which the rules of English grammar seem to be ill-applied, and
whose only purpose seems to be to make up for the fact that there was an
excess of full-stops in the previous news entry; therefore the necessity of
including a news entry in which there are as few full stops as possible is, or
at least becomes, apparent for all to see./falls over.
