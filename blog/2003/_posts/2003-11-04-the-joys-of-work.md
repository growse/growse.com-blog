title: "The joys of work"
---
I've decided that work is bad. It has taken me a surprisingly long time to
come to this conclusion, but I went through a long trial period with it, and
have now officially decided that I can't be arsed.Still, more to go round for
the rest of the general population.This is turning into a surreal evening.
I've been drawing/writing things on walls. Not my walls, obviously, but
someone elses. There is also a very good reason why, but it eludes me for the
moment. The dragon looks fairly funky. :-)
