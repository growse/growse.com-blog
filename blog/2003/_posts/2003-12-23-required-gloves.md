title: "Required: Gloves."

I still need to buy some gloves. It's getting rather cold now, and most of the
time I can't feel what my hands are doing which, I can assure you, is a bad
thing. So I'll probably go to London in a minute and get some. London might be
overkill, but necessary in the sense that I like it and it's far away from
here. Ah. Joys.
