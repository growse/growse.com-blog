Well, according to those lovely people at the [BBC][1], it was going to be a
really warm sunny bank holiday. It rained. However, the upshot of all that is
that my [birdie][2] (apologies for tiny picture) arrived this morning, which
will eventually turn into a decent desklamp so that I can banish the crap one
I have to the pit of crap things. I only really have 1 thing to do, and that's
put lots and lots and lots of posters up round Cambridge. Fun!
