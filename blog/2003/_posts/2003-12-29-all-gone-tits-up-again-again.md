title: "All gone tits up. Again. Again."

Well, had an interesting yesterday. After the no sleep for about 40 hours bit,
I managed to make my credit card vanish, which I initially thought was a
fairly impressive feat given that I havn't used it yet. It also means that I
now can't buy anything. At all. (By anything, I mean big exciting things like
presents for people).

Now I'm off to play some pianos.
