I just got told that I'm placed 36th in the room ballot. For those of you who
don't know (all of you) the ballot is this wonderfully random system that
determines what rooms people get in college.Basically, every first year gets
given a random room in one of two buildings. Then, every current first gets
given a random number and therefore the entire year is put into a randomly
generated list. This determines the order in which people pick rooms to live
in next year. For the second years going into the third year, the list is the
same, but reversed. People doing 4 years are inserted randomly into the list
between 30 and 90. Anyway, the upshot is that the complete ballot has about
240 people on it (2 years worth).And I'm 36th :)/breaths in.
