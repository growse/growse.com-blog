title: "What a strange day"
---
Yesterday, I was bored, so I decided to play in a concert. Well, the more
accurate version is that I was asked at about 4ish whether I had a recording
of a particular work (Shostakovich 2nd Piano Concerto) by a muchly distressed
flautist and the next thing I knew I was playing the piccolo in the concert
that evening. All in all, rather strange.And it's taken him 2 and a half
years, but my director of studies has finally realised that I'm overworked.
