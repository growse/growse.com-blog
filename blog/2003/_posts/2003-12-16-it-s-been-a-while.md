title: "It's been a while"

It's been a week in fact. I've been slightly busy trying to do this job which
requires me to build a database. Honestly, it's a lot more exciting than it
sounds. Really.

To be fair, the joy of getting up really early and being greeted with some of
the best views (Tower Bridge at dawn) is fab, despite the fact that it's about
-20 outside.

There's a piece of paper stuck to my desk that has a list of "Things to Do".
I'm working with 2 other people on this particular project, and most of the
things to do have my name next to them. Hmmmmm...........Still, I've done most
of them, although no-one else knows that :)
