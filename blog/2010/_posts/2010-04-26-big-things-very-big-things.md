title: "Big things. Very big things."

No updates for a while, life is a little hectic right now with lots going on.
Most importantly, I'm involved in a very complex process of house-stalking,
which usually means wearing dark glasses and hiding in cafes in small sleepy
villages scattered across the country.

I'm a little hazy on the details, but I'm led to believe that I should shortly
expect to be frustrated by a combination of estate agents, banks and
solicitors before finally emerging triumphant into a new chapter of my life
which I shall call: DIY.
