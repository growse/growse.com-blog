title: "Seasonal Decline"

This is going to sound horribly clich√©d, but time appears to have flown by.
It's now September, which is frankly ridiculous. What I expect of September is
a packed set of memories of a great and glorious summer where the weather was
fantistic and I got a lot of things done. Sadly, September is not delivering
on any of these things.

I did just spend a rather nice time in the north bit of Scotland, where I
visited a pleasing number of distilleries, breweries and waterfalls. I think I
might just go back.
