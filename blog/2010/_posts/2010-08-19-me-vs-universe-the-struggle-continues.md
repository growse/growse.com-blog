As I've turned older, I've noticed I've started doing "old people" things.
However, this seems to have been accompanied by a number of "old people"
problems.

For example, I found out yesterday that the person 3 rungs up my house-buying
chain have decided that they don't want to be a part of this any more, and
have run away. This leaves me in the position where I have a house to buy, the
people I'm buying off have a house to buy, but the people they're buying off
suddenly do not have a house to buy. There's something wrong with a system
that enables so much time wasting and frustration to be inflicted on me by a
person I've never met, who is merely trying to buy a house somewhere in East
Anglia. However, this seems to be the system we've got. I'm pessimistic about
being in by Christmas now.

I'm also doing other "old people" things like spending (lots of) money on
serious things like motor vehicles. Back in September, I [bought a little 125
motorbike][1] for the purposes of commuting. Given that I'm going to be moving
to a place much further away from the office, I decided to do my proper test
and buy a bigger bike. Most of this is complete, except for the buying bit. I
hope to sort this out at the weekend. Much fun will then be had.

I'm sad the summer had gone so quickly and that I seem to have done nothing
with it. Maybe I'm just getting old and grumpy.
