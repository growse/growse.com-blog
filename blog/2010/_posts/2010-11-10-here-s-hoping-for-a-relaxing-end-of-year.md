title: "Here's hoping for a relaxing end of year"
---
Someone told me the other day, in passing, that "Stress is the biggest cause
of long-term sick leave in the country". I have no idea if they're correct or
not. It sounds plausible. I'm more worried about what they were actually
trying to tell me.

It's been a stressful year. The [house I'm trying to buy][1] is looking like
it might get bought after all. I'm currently doing three different jobs. Not
all of the furniture which is where I currently live will fit in the new
house. I've not had a proper holiday in a long time. I bought a new motorbike,
only to have it suddenly start be expensive on me.

Hopefully, all of this will change. Soon I'll be in a new house. With a new
TV. And then I'll go skiing. Because that's awesome.

And if anyone's paying attention, I'm going to be singing [Britten's War Requiem][2] in [Coventry Cathedral][3] this Saturday to commemorate the 70th
anniversary of it being bombed. 'Epic' doesn't come close to describing what
that'll be like.
