title: "Down, then up again."

It's weird how the new year has brought lots of broken things. My internet
broke at home, the bike wouldn't start this morning, glassfish crashed, the
database server ran out of memory, my phone stopped sending texts etc. etc.

Doom and gloom.

Anyway, I've fixed most of these things by kicking them. For the rest, I'll
plough on with the niggling thought in my mind that somewhere in my small
corner of the world, something isn't working properly.

At least we've not had any earthquakes.
