title: "Well, this and that"

For the record, I wasn't hacked. I just forgot to put an index.html page in.
You see, it might say home.html at the top, but that's just to make life
easier for you. It actually does some sort of complicated regular expression
to some script with some variables. Anyway, it usually does it to index.html,
but this particular webserver actually checks to see if the file exists. Oh
well.

Everything's nearly done. In my wisdom, I've dropped the perl section, as it
wasn't adding much value to anyone's life. I'll start doing more useful stuff
soon.
