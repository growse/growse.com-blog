More job success, went for an assessment for one of my other applications
today, and after 3 hours of doing stuff, I think it went ok. This is a good
thing. I'm now tidying up some work I'm doing for people, and generally happy.
I don't know why, it just seems to be a good frame of mind to be in :)

Oh, and I just wrote an sql query that reads:

"select distinct shows.title from performances inner join shows on
performances.showid=shows.id where shows.displayed=1 order by
performances.date, performances.time;"

I feel manly after that.
