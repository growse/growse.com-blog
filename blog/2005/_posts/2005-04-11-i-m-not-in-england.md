Now, I'm in New York. I don't quite know how this happened, but I'm here until
the end of the week. Whilst you lot are currently tucked up in bed, it's a
glorious sunny late afternoon here. My room is on the 22nd floor, I overlook
Times Square, the internet is cheap(ish), and I'm technically here to work.

Oh well.

Never mind. I'll find some way of living with me.

I'll stop being smug now and go out to find a bar. :)
