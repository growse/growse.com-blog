title: "After all that, it didn't work"

Remember that sql query in my last post? It works, but only after v4 of mysql.
So if you're migrating a website over to a different server out of your
control, only to find that it doesn't work, you then spend a few hours
figuring out that mysql v3.23 works differently. Oh well.

I thought I'd write this entry as I'm currently installing gentoo for want of
anything better to do. So I'm typing this in links2, the well loved text
browser. People should use text browsers more. Pictures are overrated. Really.

Pah, only a few more hundred hours and then it's done, and the sound won't
work.
