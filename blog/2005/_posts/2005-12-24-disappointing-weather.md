title: "Disappointing Weather"

So, it's Christmas Eve and it's not snowing. I suppose the northerners feel
it's quite amusing, bringing me up here last year and decorating the place
with lovely snow to make me nearly like it, and then providing just some sort
of lame 'freezing fog' this year. Pah.

Not only that, but the house opposite were just thoughtful enough to set their
burglar alarm off. Armed only with a small stick and The Blonde One's dad, a
brief (cold) investigation revealed that people here sometimes just don't
understand some technological stuff - like the fact you need to put the right
code in to turn it off. Honestly.

I'm on the xda so long text is painful, but hope everyone has a nice Christmas
where far too much food is eaten. That's what i'm planning anyway.
