title: "Goodbye, happy office"
---
Well, the day has arrived. This is the day when I say goodbye to Fleet Street
as my place of work, and hello to Canary Wharf. The entire company is
relocating, and this weekend is my department's big move. A lot of people have
gone already, and as a result, this building has a super-efficient network
which no-one is using. Oh well.

So, there's not a lot to do today, other than sit around, wait for boxes to
turn up to put stuff in (were meant to be here on Tusday), and wait for labels
to put things on (we don't have enough).

This is meant to be a "very smooth clockwork-like operation". Pah.
