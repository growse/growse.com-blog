Well, I went to see what the hype about XHTML was, and saw that it was a good
idea. So now I'm going to make this wonderful site fully XHTML 1.0 compliant.
I'll probably use strict as some sort of punishment for myself, but I'm toying
with the idea of alienating all IE users (91% of the internet apparently) by
serving it up as applicaion/xhtml+xml rather than text/html. Hmmmmm...........

If it doesn't work for a bit, that'll be why. You could solve it by either
waiting for me to change my mind, or by using a better browser. Like firefox
:)
