title: "And a happy new year to everyone :)"

Well, I just got back from Wales where I spent the new year with a few people
I knew. It was rather nice on the north coast, near Colwyn Bay. We went down
to the beach at about 9pm on the 31st, tried to light a fire, let off some
fireworks, got cold and came inside and turned trivial pursuits into a
drinking game. Fun!

Now that the new year is here, I think it's important to start doing some
things right. Like paying rent on time, getting a job, and not being so
grumpy. :-)
