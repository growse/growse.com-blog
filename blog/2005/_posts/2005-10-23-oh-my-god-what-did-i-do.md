I bought something from Apple.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It must be said, much as I think this company is evil, has the strangest
marketing policy of the lot (2.5% market share, so lets price ourselves out of
the market and hope a consumer fad happens - worked for the ipod), has an even
weirder upgrade policy (throw it away, and buy a new one!), it must be said
they make good keyboards. I've gotten bored with my logitech one here, and
I've heard many a good thing said about the apple pro. If, of course, it's
crap, I'll send it back.

Probably with some hate mail.
