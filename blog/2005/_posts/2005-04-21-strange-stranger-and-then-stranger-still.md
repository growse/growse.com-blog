title: "Strange, stranger, and then stranger still."

For reasons that I won't go into, I have 3 monitors on my desk. My desktop
spans all three. Actually the main is because I'm a developer.

And I just found a good way to see if a website is done vaguely properly in
CSS: Expand browser to resolution of 3072x768. Actually browsing the internet
in something this wide is very very very strange. And quite addictive.
