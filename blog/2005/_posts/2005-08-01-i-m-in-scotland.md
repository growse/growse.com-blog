title: "I'm in Scotland!"
---
Technology this time won't fail me. Doing 98mph and just went across the
border into hilly/grassy/sunny/cloudy/grey/miserable Scotland. Usefully, I
forgot that my railcard had run out back in June, so the ticket checking
person gave me some "stern words" before charging me an extra £30 to stand up
most of the way. Thankfully, lots of people got off at York, so I got a seat.

So, if the course of things is normal, I'm going to get to the venue to find
out they've lost our application, don't know who we are, have no record of us
giving them any money, and will have also lost the £2000 or so worth of kit
I'm having delivered there. Just like old times :)
