Well, not rainy as such. I should do a real update every once in a while.

I came back from New York. I bought Vodka. Cheap. Now I'm back where I usually
am on a weekday, and have to fill out 3 A4 diagrams of 47U high rack cabinets.
That's after I've decided what I'm going to put in them. After that, there's a
website which I don't know what's going on that needs to be updated, and then
taken down and completely re-written.

And then I'll have lunch.
