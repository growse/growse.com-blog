title: "New laptop"

Hurray! They gave me a laptop! It's a nice T42 Thinkpad, with cool toys like a
built-in keyboard light, fingerprint authentication and bluetooth.

*does little dance*

Ahem. Anyway, it turns out that they give me quite interesting things to do.
Like write reports and figure out why stuff doesn't work. And stuff. I might
go abroad. One day.

On a different note, it's sunny!!! Well, it has been. Really really "I don't
need a coat" warm, which, given that it's March, is quite remarkable.

Must go, duvet calls.
