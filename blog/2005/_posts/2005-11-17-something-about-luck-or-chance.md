There must be this thing that dictates that as soon as I have to be in work
early (like, for an 8am meeting), I find that on getting there, there's an
email telling me it has been cancelled. This just happened.

I'm actually feeling really sleepy still, so I might read the paper for a bit
and then do some stuff that needs doing.

I put a suit on especially as well........
