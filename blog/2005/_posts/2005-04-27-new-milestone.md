I just read something shocking: The [Gentoo Wiki][1] was hacked.

For those of you who don't know, I shall explain what both Gentoo and a Wiki
is.

Gentoo is a linux distribution. It is based on the following concept: Whenever
you want to install something, you go download the source code and then
compile it. Upside is that you can customize it to include stuff you need and
get rid of crap you don't. Downside is that a complete install can take 2
whole days of compiling. Oh well. There's a love/hate thing about it.

A Wiki is an amazing invention. It is a website, but one in which anyone is
free to change. If you need to create a centre of information, a wiki is
useful as any incomplete/incorrect data can be updated by real people who
actually know what they're talking about. The [Wikipedia][2] is a general
encyclopedia, but in a Wiki format.

From the above, you might conclude that "hacking" wiki isn't necessarily a
difficult. Thing. In fact, it might involve something as complicated as
"editing the page" which you wish to "hack".

Oh Dear.

In other news, I now own some stuff, I'm eating lunch, and drawing pretty
things in Photoshop. Also, I'm going back to New York (yay!) in a month. Yay!
