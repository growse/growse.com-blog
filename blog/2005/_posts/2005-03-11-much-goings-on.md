Odd things have happened. These include the following:

  * I gave nearly Â£900 to someone at random, instead of my landlord. The bank
say 6-8 weeks to get it back.

  * Apparently I'm starting work on Wednesday and not, as I had previously
thought, September

  * DOS line feeds breaks perl. So does Wordpad.

  * Mod rewrites are fun.

Anyway, must go. Washing up to do.
