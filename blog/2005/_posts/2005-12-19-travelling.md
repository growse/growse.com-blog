So I'm loaded up with presents and other nice things and am therefore off up
to Manchester now for the remaining few days of this year. Leaving Euston
about........... now. Wireless stuff is wonderful :-)

Thankfully, there wasn't such a heaving rush to race to the train as there
usually is in Euston. So I've managed to bag a nice table seat with everything
I need. Lunch is next.
