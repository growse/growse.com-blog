I'm going to Edinburgh again, and I think the reason is well summed up by the
word "socks". So once again I get to fight my way through the rush hour (bank
holiday weekend) commuter rush as I struggle to find a person-size space on a
train which has no seat with my name on it.

I might have to shoot some people to get my way, but I'll make sure I'll be
humane.
