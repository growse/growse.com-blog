I'm currently sitting outside my house. On the wall. You may be wandering why.
Well, I'll tell you.

I'm locked out. I've come home from a hard day at the office and everyone
seems to have buggered off. So I'm left with the internet and my mp3 player
waiting for 'them with keys' to return. Still, it could be worse. I could be
naked.

They're back now. Hurrah!
