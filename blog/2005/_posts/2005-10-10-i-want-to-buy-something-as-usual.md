title: "I want to buy something. As usual."

After deciding about a year ago to buy a freeview box, I'm now actually going
to do it. The problem is, I want a PVR as well, and don't want two separate
boxes sitting under the telly. This problem was solved when I found out that
there are some companies who make combined freeview/PVR boxes. The only
downside is that they all seem to be crap at it. After having wandered around
the internet for about an hour, I've found that pretty much every single model
on the market has huge problems in most things usually related to the
recording-video or watching-tv 'features' on the box. It could be argued that
these two things are quite important. And so I roam on, trying to find a
manufacturer on this planet that makes something that actually works and
satisfies more than the average 112-year-old granny who just likes the fact
that it's a shiney silver box.

Honestly.
