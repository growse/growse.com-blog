title: "Stuff!"

I had a plan. It was a very good plan. I was going to go to New York in April,
and buy a [Canon 350D][1] at some nice US price and get my £100 for [buying it
on a MasterCard][2]. Then, I was idly browsing round, and found that the offer
ends on the 31st December, which is about 3 days away. Sudden panic set in, so
I bought one today. At a reasonable price, and with the £100 off, I'm getting
it cheaper than I would do in the US without the £100 off (by about £60). The
only problem now is that it's a body only, and I need a lens until I can use
it so I'll be looking round ebay for something decent and cheap over the next
few weeks. Ah well. Got the deposit back for the last house I lived in
finally, so that's what's financing all of this, just in case my bank manager
is reading......

Other things I did today was to do a new stylesheet for the new year. It's
actually quite good (in my humble opinion) and is a little different to the
designs I've had before. Not 100% sure about the main colour yet, but at least
I've got everything in the right place in both FF and IE. It'll go up at the
new year so everyone can go "ooooo" then as I know you all like doing that.
And it'll stay unchanged for at least 3 months. Promise.

Now I've got to go to bed. It's cold and damp. And it's going to snow.
