title: "Everything is broken :-("
---
I have a to-do list. It's quite long. Some of it involves fixing some of the
things the dissenters are complaining about, like updating the styles to make
it look like I actually spent some time on them (which I didn't). Also, I need
to fix the guestbook, which is broken. Actually, I'll probably dump the
guestbook in favour of news item comments, which is the way to go I think.
Hmmm, yes. That's sensible.

However, these things are way below the usual to-do list stuff, like
"laundry", "work", "eating" and other such fun things. I'll have a crack at it
over the weekend, if I get time (I won't - more exciting things to do). That
and a nice new video section for cool time-lapse stuff.

Must dash - Rover beckons.
