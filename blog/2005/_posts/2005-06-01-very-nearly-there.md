Not too far to go now. Just finished the guestbook script, which still has a
few issues I want to sort out. All that remains to be done is the downloads
and links page. Both of which I might rehash anyway. Then I just have to build
the admin backend, so I don't have to enter news entries manually, in a SQL
statement.Pics of nice shiney mp3 player are on their way - promise, along
with a bunch of cool things I've been experimenting with recently.
