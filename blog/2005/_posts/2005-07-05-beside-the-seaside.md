Well, it's Wales, so it wouldn't be the same if it didn't rain. If you're
wondering, it did - this morning, and quite hard.

Taking the cue from the charactaristic summery weather, I did the only thing I
could do. I went shoe shopping. Not only that, I also bought shoes! I'm
excited, but mainly because I don't have to do any more shoe shopping for
another 3 years at least.

Oh well, never mind.
