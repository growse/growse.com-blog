Finally! I've finished my training (4 weeks!) and am now back on the wonderful
job of actually trying to do something useful. I'm in my first day in a
slightly different role and already have had a meeting. Feeling very efficient
here. :-)

On a slightly different note, I have grand plans for this site. By popular
request, I'm putting a few more photos up, changing the way the photo section
is layed out, and maybe adding an exciting videos section (no, not porn) for
video-like things.

I want to be in Las Vegas :-(
