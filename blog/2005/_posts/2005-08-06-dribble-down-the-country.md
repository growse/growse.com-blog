On a train again. There's no direct trains from Edinburgh to London, so I'm on
this strange thing that's going to take me to Prague first I think before
depositing me in the Atlantic. After that, it's swimming the whole way. Apart
from that, it's been a good week. The show's really good (COME AND SEE IT!!!!)
although I left my camera in the theatre, so no pictures for a month. Must go
get that back at some point......
