Well, i'm sitting here after just been told I'm onto the next stage for one of
my job applications (Wooooohooooooo) and at the same time trying to find a
band for a show. Life doesn't get feeling more strange.

I have to complete a numeracy test now, which will be emailed to me, and,
knowing my luck, either be filtered as spam, or, knowing my luck further, be
infested, with commas. Now I just have to finish everything, and my life will
be complete. For today.
