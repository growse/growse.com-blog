title: "I should put something here"

I should say something, but not a lot has been going on.

I wrote an RSS ticker, for work. Work seems happy with it.

I'm going to Edinburgh on Monday, by train, to start the show. Should be fun,
although I did have to put £816 worth of hire stuff on my credit card which
I'm therefore owed. That did get me a whole £4 in cashback though. Bonus!I'm
shooting things tomorrow. With a shotgun.

Hmmmmmmmmmmm......
