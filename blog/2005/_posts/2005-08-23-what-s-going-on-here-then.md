title: "What's going on here then?"
---
I've been having a mildly non-interesting week.

Many things have happened that have dull (the washing, the ironing etc) and a
few none dull things (birthday, beer, trying to move house etc). The moving
house one is interesting due to the complex nature of the "negotiations" going
on between 6 people who want to live together, a landlord who we think lives
on a completely different continent, and an agent who apparently can't spell.
So this is actually being a little bit of a fun time. Still, with a fixed
moving date of 3rd September, by which time I need to have bought things like
beds and sofas, it's roaring up like a large thing that roars.

On the upside, I got cake, which was good.
