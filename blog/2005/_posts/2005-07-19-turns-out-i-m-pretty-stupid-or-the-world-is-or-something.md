Well, I'm sat here ready to RMA my disk (see below), when I need to run the
maxtor diagnostic program on it to get a "status code" or something.

I plug it into one of the office machines, run the diagnostic, and it tells me
the drive is perfect. And then I find out that the linux kernel has a bug in
it which with certain controllers makes it look like the drive isn't readable
at some points. Feeling very very very very annoyed now, I buy a new
controller. An expensive one. But it should solve my problems, along with
doing fancy things at the same time. Pah.
