title: "More goodness"

So as my first paycheck came slithering through the door, I bought my first
bargain/toy/work enhancer: A wireless access point. After shopping around, and
hearing bad things about WEP and good things about WPA, I decided to shop
around for an access point that did WPA, and preferably 802.11g (the quick
one). Seeing prices up in the hundreds, I was shocked to find an access point
that did all those things for Â£33.15. Thank you Dabs :)

Anyway, it turned up, I plugged it in, shouted at it for a bit for not
working, got it working, went "ooo", and am now sitting on the sofa basking in
the radiation that is secure wireless goodness.

I will learn, one day.
