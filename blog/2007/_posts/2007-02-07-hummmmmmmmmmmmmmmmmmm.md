Life has been humming along here, fairly uneventfully. In fact, it's so
absolutely uneventful, I'm struggling to come up with anything to say. I'm on
holiday next week, for an entire week - how I managed to pull that one off at
such short notice I'm not sure. I'll probably end up in Wales.

I've re-started my project to back up all my DVDs at home, so that I can
browse through them with the aid of something like [MythTV][1]. So far, it's
working pretty well, but I anticipate that I'll run out of space some at some
point soon. Given the number of DVDs I have, I may need storage of the order
of Terabytes, but I'll think about that frantic-buying issue when I get to it.

As far as projects go, I'm a bit swamped.
