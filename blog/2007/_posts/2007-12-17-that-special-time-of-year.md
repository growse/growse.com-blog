title: "That special time of year"
---
One of the great advantages of having a real job is that it really makes you
appreciate the holidays which you're given. For example - I'm on holiday for
the next couple of weeks until the new job (yay!) starts in January. To
celebrate my first non-working Monday in at least a month, I'm having toast
for lunch. This is something I'm unable to do in the office, unless I get some
at 9:30 and hang on to it for a few hours. This isn't something I'm likely to
be very successful at.

Of course, holidays are meant to be for going away to sandy beaches, skiing in
the snowy alps or other such frivolous activities. However, inspired by a lack
of ability to pay for anything, I'm increasingly becoming happy to just sit
around and do nothing. In this particular case, "nothing" equates to doing the
dishes, hoovering, tidying up, sorting my clothes out, packing a bit for the
trip to Manchester, doing the dishes again because I ate toast, re-packing
etc. etc.

I've just realised that I want to go back to work. :-(
