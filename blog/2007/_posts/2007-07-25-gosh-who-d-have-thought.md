title: "Gosh, who'd have thought?"

I'm fairly surprised. I changed my job role and moved into something I didn't
know very much about. This meant I had no idea whether it would be slow and
dull, or fast-paced and interesting. Half-expecting the former, I'm rather
pleased to find out that it's rather interesting. Hugely busy, but that's
something I'm used to. I suppose I have to say nice things as they're sending
me away in a few days.

Now, I've heard mixed things about St Louis. Some people, apparently, love it
and some really think that there is nothing worse than spending a month in
some dusty midwest city. It's slightly worrying that the people who like are
the slightly strange types who most people like to avoid. In any case, it's
the US. The food can't be that bad....
