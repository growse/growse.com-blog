title: "New(ish) job!"

Well hurrah. Today is the first day of my new job role, which is completely
different to what I've been doing before. Needless to say, I'm now doing a
whole bunch of training about regulatory stuff - fun! I'll be here until the
end of August before I rush off into something else and at some point they'll
probably send me to a different country. Could be interesting...

Went back to Penshurst yesterday to see what had changed about the area around
where I used to live. Not a lot, as it turns out - I'm thinking of eventually
buying a house, somewhere, and was considering Kent to be a possibility.
However, there's that problematic issue of not being able to afford even a
single brick until I'm earning about 6 times what I am now. That probably
won't happen for a while. Despite these issues, I had a look round everywhere.
Oxted seemed nice, but expensive. Might have a look further east. Until
something successful happens, I fear that I'm resigned to renting.

I've also re-discovered the joys of time-lapse photography. This probably
means that the [Videos][1] section of the site will be expanding at some
point...
