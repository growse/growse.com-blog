title: "A couple of interesting weeks"
---
It's been about 14 days since I last posted. In that time, I've learned a few
things.

  1. Midwest US is hot. Really really hot.

  2. The know how to build rollercoasters out here.

  3. They're also really good at that air-conditioning thing.

  4. Food here is BIG.

  5. Stuff here is cheap.

And I'm not coming home for another two weeks at best. It's nice here, but I'd
have England any day. The summers don't melt your face for a start.
