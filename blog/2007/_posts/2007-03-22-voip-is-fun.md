title: "VoIP is fun!"

Well, I finally got around to setting up my own home VoIP system. Because it
took me such a long time and caused so many headaches, I thought I'd write
about it, [here][1]. Not for anyone else's benefit, mainly because I'll need
to remember how to do it when I go and accidentally delete everything.
