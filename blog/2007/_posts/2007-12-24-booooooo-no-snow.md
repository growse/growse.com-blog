title: "Booooooo. No snow."

Today is officially the first day of my new job, but given the time of year,
I've decided to take my first week off. I've already been emailed stuff to do
though, so I'll have to do some sort of hitting-the-ground-running thing when
I start for real in January.

This can only be a short entry, I'm off to sit in a car whilst someone else
tells me what to do. Happy Christmas to all. Hope it's snowing somewhere :)
