title: "Holy crap it's snowing! Again!"

Now, it doesn't normally do this here in London, but it's snowing again.
Amazingly, those clever weather predictors got it right and there is a
significant amount. Well, I say significant - 2 inches is quite a lot for
London, but it's not exactly lose-your-car-until-spring Newfoundland snow.

All this meant I decided to get an early (7:18) train in, which results in it
currently being 8:05am, and being only one of two people on my floor at my
desk. A fairly surreal experience. Also, the LSE just opened (I think) so
watching the little numbers tick by as the overnight trades are filled was
quite fun.

Right. Time for some actual work!
