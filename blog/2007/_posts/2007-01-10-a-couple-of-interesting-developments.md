title: "A couple of interesting developments"
---
It's been an exciting start to the new year. New job, which means new things
to do. I started last Thursday and have so far learned many things which I
didn't know before. I think I'm actually starting to do something that's
useful as well, which appears to be a good thing. I will be needing a new suit
though, as my only slightly tatty suit might not be able to sustain the rigors
of everyday use.

My stuff showed up from the US. Amazingly, it was (a) all complete and (b)
completely working! Shame it doesn't fit anywhere in the flat that I'm now
living in.

I bought the domain [growse.me.uk][1]! Not sure why - it was cheap and I
thought that I might as well have a .uk level domain, so I got it.

I will now go and continue the great tidyfest.
