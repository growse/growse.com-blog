Well, It's snowing, in London. This never happens, but this morning was
particularly pretty. I've been out and taken a few photos, but nothing
amazing. I had to trudge all the way to the station to discover that the
wonderful train company had cancelled all the trains going to London. Still,
that means I get to work from home, which isn't all that bad. I just have to
figure out what lunch is going to look like.
