I've just spent the last week in the wonderful lake district. Despite being
February, the weather wasn't too bad at all, and I got to see some nice hills
and things. Lakes too if I remember correctly. The whole trip was great, until
I noticed that my [camera lens][1] was broken. It seems to work perfectly, but
it won't focus shorter than about 0.8-0.9m. Considering it's a pretty
reasonable macro lens, this is very very annoying. What is also very very
annoying is that it's 13 months old, and therefore very conveniently outside
of it's warranty period. I'm thinking I'll just live with it for a few months
and then buy a [Canon 24-70L f2.8][2] when I've saved up. Hopefully nothing
else will break in the next few weeks - I can't really afford it.

I'm in Manchester now, and will be back in London tomorrow. There's a large
pile of stuff to be ebay'ed which is both good and bad - bad because it's
work, good because it creates both space and money at the same time. Once
that's all gone, I can go back to buying new things to fill up the space with.
