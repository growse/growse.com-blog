title: "BT. Fail."
---
Back in those heady days before I had a phone line, I put in a request to my
ISP to move my ADSL to my new address. I explained to them how I didn't have a
phone line at that time, but would have one about two days afterwards. "No
problem" I was told, "We'll put it through when you become registered as the
person paying that bill".

All was good for a week. I had my activation date (today) sent to me. I phone
up the ISP this morning to find out that BT have cancelled my ADSL move
request because "there is no phone line at that address". Cue this
conversation:

  * ISP: You need to call BT to find out why they havn't put a line in at that
address.

  * Me: There is a line at that address. I'm talking to you on it.

  * ISP: Oh. That's a bit weird.

  * Me: It appears BT havn't actually got a clue what's going on.

  * ISP: Yes, it seems that way doesn't it.

  * Me: You've also sent me a bill for November for my old address. I don't
have internet access, I'm not paying it.

  * ISP: But your internet hasn't moved, it's still being provided to the old
address

  * Me: But I don't *live* there any more or pay the phone bill.

  * ISP: You've moved house?

  * Me: *cries*

A thoroughly entertaining morning, I'm sure you'll agree. They've re-requested
the order and they'll claim to "keep an eye on it", whatever that means. Maybe
it'll invade Poland if they're not careful.
