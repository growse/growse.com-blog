Not a lot has been happening recently. And I really can't be bothered to write
anything exciting. That said, I seem to be doing a lot of waiting at the
moment.

The good news is that I'm planning the Christmas theme properly this year, so
hopefully it'll be GOOD! Although I'll probably decide it's awful on December
2nd and replace with something else. We'll see.
