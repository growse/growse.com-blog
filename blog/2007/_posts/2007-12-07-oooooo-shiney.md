Well, everyone will no doubt be thrilled to hear that I got me a new job! Yay.
This is good as the people in my current job weren't really prepared to pay me
after the end of this year, so finding someone willing to keep giving me money
fits into my world domination plan quite well. It does mean that I'm going to
have to become an expert in what I actually do (otherwise, what's the point?)
and that thing is going to be security! Not shooting-at-bad-guys-with-guns
security, more making-sure-people-build-systems-correctly security, with a fat
dollop of documentation on the side.

It's been fun in my last placement. My most enjoyable moment was probably the
trader who phoned me up, spoke very quickly at me before hanging up again.
Figuring out what the hell he wanted was actually a fairly interesting
challenge.

I've been playing with Sun's Solaris recently. I mentioned in my last post
that I'm having to use PostgreSQL for a work project and it happens to only be
supported on Solaris for my purposes. I've been finding out that it's
basically the same as linux, but purposefully more difficult. Still, it has
[ZFS][1], which is amazingly cool, so that makes up for it. Just need to wait
for that one to be ported to a sensible OS.
