A strange thing happened last night. I went to the cinema, but before going in
I was told that all the staff were on strike over wages. To be honest, they
sounded like they had a point - they were paid the basic minimum wage (£5.65ph
or something) whereas the London poverty wage is something like £6.40 per hour
and a recent study has suggested that the London minimum wage should be
£7.something. Given that the company had apparently refused even to raise
their wage to today's poverty level over 3 years, they had decided to strike.
Fair enough. However, I'd spent the money travelling to where we were, we'd
had a nice dinner out and were looking to watch a film. I appreciate what the
staff were trying to do, but making us cross some sort of picket line seemed a
bit heavy-handed. Oh well, film was confusing as well.

In other news, we got a Wii. It's great! I need to hook it up to the wireless
now. :)
