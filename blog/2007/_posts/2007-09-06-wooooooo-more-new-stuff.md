title: "Wooooooo! More new stuff"
---
I'm back in the land of reality now, having taken a week's holiday in a
sensible place with lots of hills. I started a new job role (again) back on
Monday and one thing about this particular speciality is becoming fairly
apparent.

I know nothing. At all.

This means I have to learn it, and fairly quickly. Inexplicably, I'm staying
in a hotel in Tower Hill next week, so this prevents me from learning stuff
about this job, but I might learn other stuff about other things. It's called
'training' or something.
