Well, happy new year everyone. Last year I managed to do a few things I hadn't
anticipated doing this time last year, like going to Asia and staying on
another continent for six months. Hopefully this year will be similarly filled
with nice things :)

This time next year, I'll hopefully have a new job as I leave the grad scheme.
Will be interesting to see where I end up. Covered in chocolate if this year
is anything to go by...
