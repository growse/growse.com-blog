My piano arrived!

Now, Chopin.

P.S. as the piano mover was hauling it into the room, I mentioned that it was
of a particular attachment, given that it was the piano I leant on. He
casually mentioned that "his mate, Tim Minchin, had been trying to get him to
learn for the past 4 years". Seriously? [Tim Minchin][3]?! Not sure if I was
being had on. If I were, it's a fairly obscure joke to make...
