title: "Too much to do. Far too much to do."

Unfortunately, I've havn't been able to give any updates here, because I've
been far too busy. There's a lot going on at the moment, so I've had to bin /
put on hold various things that I've been trying to fix. The [photos][1] bit
is still down, waiting for me to write some code there.

I did go skiing though. And it was successful, in that I still retain control
over most of my limbs. That and the fact that the snow this year is
(apparently) the best in 20 years, helped make a good time.
