title: "Gosh, what? Java? Who?"

It's been a while coming, but I've finished the Java-version of this site and
deployed it onto [Glassfish][1]! Hurrah. So far, it's different in that it's
better, faster and less broken. It may brake every now and again though, so if
that happens, bear with me. It's rather cunning, because all the messy
infrastructure bits (databases, email) are all abstracted away from the code
and kept in the app server, so I can deploy the same codebase on as many
different environments that I want.

The [links][2] page is probably the most changed. It now pulls in my
[Delicious][3] account. So far, there's only two links on there, but I'll add
more through time. It's basically my bookmark list, so it's probably only
useful to me. Still, at least it's useful to me.

I'll tinker some more. Maybe I could figure out how to get it to email me when
it breaks.
