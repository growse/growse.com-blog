Been adding a few things. Started a page on [strange ways of generating a
mandelbrot image][1], mainly for amusement purposes. I'll update it with
pictures and more stuff later.

Also, the photos bit is back up. Going with the [JQuery][2] mode of
development, it works rather well in firefox (and a few others). A bit broken
in IE, but I'll get round to fixing that at some point.

And looking at [SpamWatch][3], all I'm thinking is 'wow'. No news being
reported of an increase in spam globally, so maybe I'm just being targetted
more. Or someone's trying to send me a message by spamming me and then drawing
letters in the graph. Who knows?
