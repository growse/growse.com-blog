I just did a gig. By "gig" I mean I sang with 4 other people at this thing
that's called the Gugenheim Dinner. It's essentially a party held by college
for anyone who has lots of money or is a fellow. Anyway, we had to sing for a
grand total of 5 minutes, and havn't been paid yet. Hopefully that'll happen
tomorrow. And it allowed us to get some Slime sport action in.
