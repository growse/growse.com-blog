Today I woke up at 8:15. I then put on a suit and went to see the bank
manager.Walked away at 10:10 having secured (with the help of my "business
associate") Â£10,000 at only 3% for the company I'm setting up. I'm still
mildly shocked that the manager thought our idea was a good one, and was quite
happy to give us what we needed.Not a bad day as things go.
