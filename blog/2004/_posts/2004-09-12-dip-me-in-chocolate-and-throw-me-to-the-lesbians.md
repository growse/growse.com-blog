Went to see Jerry Springer: The Opera last night. Rather a good show, very
offensive, very funny. Got the feeling that they had too much money left over
at the end and spent it all on the last 5 minutes, but that's all in the
spirit of having too much money.

Anyway, I'm in The Royal Republic of Ruislip now. I can't explain that one
either, apart from to say that it's a better country than France. Just.

I now need to debate with myself the quickest way from here back home to
Stratford, and then the quickest way after that to Manchester. Oh well.
