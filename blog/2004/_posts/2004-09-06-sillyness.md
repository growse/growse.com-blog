I did a silly thing.When I turned my server back on on returning from
edinburgh, it was dead. I took the power bit out and tested it, and it was
dead. Sighing slightly, I ordered (Â£70) a new one.

Did it at any moment occur to me to test that the fuse in the power cable
might have gone and that the original power bit was ok? No. Of course it
didn't.

Now it's plugged in and everything I don't have the heart to take the new one
out. It's all shiney, and called Ronald.

At least I have a spare.
