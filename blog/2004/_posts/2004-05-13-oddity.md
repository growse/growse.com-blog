I've just noticed that I'm bailing news entries by the dozen. Something's
seriously up with notnet which means that every time that I add a news entry,
it loses some entries. This is rather annoying and it's probably telling me
that I should be paying for mysql which wouldn't do this sort of thing. Ah
well.
