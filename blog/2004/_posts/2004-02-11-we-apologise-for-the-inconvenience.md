Well, I did it, the big site re-design. That sounds like I had it planned for
months, whereas actually I saw someone else use CSS for a layout purpose
thingie and decided that I needed to try it. Much head banging later, and it
isn't finished, but it's close.

If you're using Firefox, I hate you. If you're using Opera, I hate your
browser. If you're using IE, I hate not only you, your existance, your
browser, but I won't make any effort to make it look good for you.
