title: "The mystery of travel"

And now I'm in Ireland.

To be fair, not a lot has gone wrong. We were fine right up until check-in,
when we were told we had missed the flight. After pointing out that the flight
didn't leave for an hour and a half, they decided that it might have been a
mistake on their part. Then, after the joys of having my bag searched and some
scissors confiscated (which I never even knew existed), we landed in a
slightly damp and noisy Dublin.

Picking the weekend before St. Patrick's Day to go to Dublin was possibly not
a smart move, as finding somewhere to nosh and have a "quiet" drink was an
almost impossible task. That said, things have been distinctly quieter, if
wetter, today.

Odd place. Like England with different money and a strange language.
Hmmmmm.......
