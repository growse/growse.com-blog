title: "Hurrah! Christmas is here"

It is done. I finally sorted out the christmas theme for the site. It should
be coming up the moment the clock ticks into december. We'll see...I also took
the time to center the site in IE. It's always meant to have been centered,
but IE doesn't know what margin:auto; means, so I had to hack it. Oh well.
