About 3-4 months ago I started writing a website that was to be the shop front
for an online business. After a lot of work, making mistakes and fixing them,
I'm half finished. Then I discover [osCommerce][1], a free, open source
shopping cart website package which is infinately better than anything I could
have every thought of. So I ditched 3 months of work and used that instead.
Needless to say it's a lot better.
