title: "And we're back up again."

With a few changes. I broke the stylesheets last night, for some strange
reason which I can't remember. Anyway, I thought I had a backup, didn't, so
rewrote it from an earlier version. With funky corners.

And yes, I know the guestbook page doesn't work, and some of the styles aren't
finished yet, but I'm getting there, and it's lunchtime now. :)
