title: "An interesting non-worky day"
---
Well, today didn't exactly go to plan. The plan was to get up at 9:30, and
work until the afternoon, and then go to a party. However, as it turned out, I
got up at 9:30, phoned the [Arts Theatre][1] lots to try and ask permission to
do something, gave up, went all the way out to north Cambridge to [Stage
Electrics][2] to hire 2 lanterns, came back, sat down with a cat on me, went
to watch half a play, and now I'm going to go to a party.

I've got no work done, but I have two large Par-64 1kW Floorcans sat on my
desk. Joy.
