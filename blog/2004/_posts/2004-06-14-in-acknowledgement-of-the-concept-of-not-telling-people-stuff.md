Well, it's Monday night, which means it's [Trinity May Ball][1] tonight. I'm
not going, I'm just singing at people for an hour until 9, and then taking my
money home. This is in stark contrast to Wednesday night, where I am singing,
and playing, so get paid _and_ a free ticket to the Pembroke June Event (it's
not posh/expensive enough to be a May Ball).

So that's what I'm doing tonight.

That, and other things.

Possibly many other things.

Or possibly only one other thing.
