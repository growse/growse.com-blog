title: "Completely crap day."

Utterly pointless day. Meant to be doing a tech for another show which I'm
helping out on, but found myself to be useless so went home and worked
instead. Not before admiring the huge amount of smoke and slightly strange
design the show's going to have.

On a theatrical-releated note, I've put up more pictures in the [LSOH][1]
section. :-)

On a slightly less theatrical note, I got rid of a lot of random crap on this
site which was either just out of date, or I was bored with. All of the
tutorials have gone, as they weren't relevent to much, and I'm mainly just
going to use this space for my perl support, blog and pictures :)
