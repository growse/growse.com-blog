title: "That time of the week again"

Once again, I find myself in the chemistry dept. library. This time, I have an
hours wait whilst I make a lithium enolate at about -70 deg. C. Fun!!

Managed to do a concert on Saturday night, as I was playing the piccolo in
Tchaikovsky's 5th symphony. I think it's important to point out that whilst
it's a great piece to listen to, it's quite obvious that Mr. Tchaikovsky
didn't have a clue about wind instruments, especially the piccolo. It's a crap
part, and I've distinctly decided I don't like the piece any more. If it had
snowed that night, my opinion of it might be higher (don't ask), but it
didn't. And I've just been informed that I have a new bed. This day is getting
better and better already.
