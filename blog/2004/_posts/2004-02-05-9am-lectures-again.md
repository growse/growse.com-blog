title: "9am lectures again."

Well, the wonder of the chemistry course has done it's magic flippy thing
again, and now I have 9am lectures. The upside is I only have 3 of them a week
for the next 3 weeks. Still, that's more time to be spent making stuff in the
lab. A photo of my feet arrived this morning.
