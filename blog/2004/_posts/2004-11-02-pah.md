Back from the brum. I bought numerous exciting things on my visit to the magic
chocolate factory in bournville, but I've nearly eaten them all now, so the
excitement is wearing off.

And for the first time ever, I just went and hung up washing on my washing
line.

I worked out today that it's costing about Â£6000 a year for me to live in this
house, and that's just rent and bills. It's probably going to be a lot higher
than that with food etc. The really really scary thing is that I haven't got a
job yet. Oh well.

It just started raining.
