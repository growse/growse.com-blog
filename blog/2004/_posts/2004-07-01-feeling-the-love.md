There's.......

Nothing going on over here,Nothing going on over there,I just got out of
bed,And now I'm making lunch.

Sorry it doesn't rhyme. I didn't try.

In other news, I got a job. It's a dull job, but it does that important thing
which all jobs do - it pays _money_. And that's something I've not had for a
good 3 years now. To be fair, I still won't have it in a month's time, but at
least I will owe the bank slightly less money.It's also coming up to be that
time of the year when the annual Pembroke College Choir Tour gets organised. I
did it last year, people may remember, and I'm not doing it all this year,
thank god. My argument is that I have better things to do such as get this
company I started up and running, and look for a job, and other important
stuff.

Still, life is looking up. Lunch is done.
