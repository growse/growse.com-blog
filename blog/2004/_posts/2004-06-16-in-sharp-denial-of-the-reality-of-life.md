How the fuck is it possible for a person to go through a year being predicted
a 2.1/2.2 (mainly 2.1), get a really high 2.1 for coursework, and wind up with
a 3rd? What the fuck are these guys examining, because it fecking well isn't
the ability to do chemistry.

Well, that was a waste of 3 years of my life.
