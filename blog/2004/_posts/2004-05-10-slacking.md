Well, not many news entries recently. This is actually because I've been
working (no!!). That and other things which have all conspired to drive me
insane which include but do not entirely consist of: the world.

I redid the bannery thingie. Hope everyone likes it.

Oh, and if you want the secret of being able to work - install linux. You'll
firstly get no work done as you try and get everything working, but then you
admit defeat. When you realise that you like it so much that you don't want to
uninstall it, and that nothing (like sound) works so you can't distract
yourself with music, films, etc. you actually decide to get work done. Genius
