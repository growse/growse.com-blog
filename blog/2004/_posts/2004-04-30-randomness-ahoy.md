title: "Randomness ahoy!"
---
As I was sitting down, spluttering through slightly more than mild illness and
trying to do some work, I learned that there was a rather random bunch of
people who were going to sing Spem in Alium (by Tallis) in St. Catz college.
For those of you who don't know, it's a early english choral piece written for
8 5-part choirs. A bit of maths tells you that you need at least 40 people to
do this. On turning up I was assigned a part (Choir 4 baritone for those
following my choral career) and found about 60 people, all of whom could sing
rather well. Anyway, we rehearsed for an hour, and then sung (just now) at the
college, outside which was a rather novel experience to say the least.

Now I have to keep on doing work and wonder why my chest suddenly hurts more
than it should.

And W00t! to 30,000 hits. :) My congratulations to host81-133-154-39.in-
