title: "In praise of sexual acts"

Well, today is Suicide Sunday. This is the official "beginning" of May Week
where everyone (except me) goes out and gets as much alcohol into them as
physically possible. I don't do this, because I have to do stuff at 6:30 which
is quite important and marks the end of me doing 3 years worth of stuff in a
certain position. That's organisational position, as opposed to physical
position.

I'm going to go write chapter 2 of my book now.
