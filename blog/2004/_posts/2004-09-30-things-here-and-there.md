title: "Things. Here and there."

I think I should try and explain to myself what I'm doing with my life. It's
actually quite a few things at the moment.

To pay the bills: I work in insurance. No, really. I'm temping for Barclays up
the road working in their life assurance complaints department. It's something
along the lines of a little while back, lots of people were mis-sold endowment
mortgages (bad things), and are subsequently complaining. Anyway, the FOS
(Financial Ombudsman Service) decide if they people have a point, at which
point Barclays figure out how much money they've lost, and write them a
cheque. Some poor group of people have to mail out a bunch of forms to the
people asking their permission to talk to the insurance lenders. Then that
same group of people have to take those completed forms, phone up the
companies, get all the information, and then mail out the letter offering the
people some money back. That's what I do all day, and it's as interesting as
it sounds.

In the evenings, I'm actually doing something I'd never thought I'd do outside
Cambridge - I'm working on a show!!!!!! It's with a bunch of people called
[The Uncertainty Division][1] who are performing until Sunday at the Baron's
Court Theatre in London. I'm teching it (apparently), although it's entirely
improvised so I have to make it up as I go along as well. It's good fun. Go
see it.

At the weekends I go to Cambridge to see people I like.

And that's what I'm doing.

I'm slightly concerned that the civil service think I can't read though.
