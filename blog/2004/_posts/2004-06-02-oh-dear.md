I managed to lose one of my handouts for one of my lecture courses. I figured
this out by taking all my handouts and putting them on the floor. After
photocopying someone else's notes, I returned to complete the line-up of
"stuff I should know"

It's quite a lot. I need to know most of the second row of that lot for
tomorrows exam. I've been examined on most of the rest.
