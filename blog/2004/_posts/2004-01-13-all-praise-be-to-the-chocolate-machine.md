title: "All praise be to the chocolate machine"

It must be my lucky day. I go to the all hallowed chocolate machine, put in
"exact money only" (35p) and I'm pleasantly rewarded with not 1, not 2, but 7
dairy milks. They're all sitting in my fridge now, and I'm sitting here being
smug :) Mmmmmmmmmmmm......
