Today, I woke up and thought "I need a new bike helmet". Well, I didn't, but
at the moment, it makes no difference whether I had done or not. I had a
small(ish) crash which resulted in me landing on my head, on a log. As well as
putting a nice big red thing on my back, and my arm. So now I really do need a
new helmet because my current one is broken. Gah. (Ow).
