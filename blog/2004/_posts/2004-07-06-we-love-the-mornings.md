Got up at 5 this morning. Well, that's not entirely true. I woke up at 5, was
asleep 30 seconds later, and then got up 35 minutes after that. Although that
said, at 2pm, I'd done a full days work, so now I'm
freeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Until 9, when I get back into
bed.

Dammit.
