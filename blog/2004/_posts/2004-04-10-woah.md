Well, I've done absolutely nothing. I tried to work, but the lack of a decent
desk and that wonderous "Cambridge atmosphere" is preventing me, so I'm going
back on Tuesday. I mean, Wednesday (ahem). Therefore I need to complete my
things-to-do list for the holiday rather more quickly. Currently, this just
involves buying a hat, but I don't like to be rushed in these sorts of
important things.

Hopefully, tomorrow I'll get to play with a new bike wheel that turned up the
other day. I justified it by claiming my previous back wheel was broken.

Company credit card turns up in a week. Mmmmmmm...........................
