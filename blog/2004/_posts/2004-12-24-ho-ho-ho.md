Well, it's Christmas eve, and this is my last entry before Christmas day. I'm
173cm, weigh 11st 1lb, and have a blood pressure of 120/70. I expect those to
all be larger (except possibly height) two days from now, as much foodage is
anticipated.

I'm near Manchester, and they think it's going to snow, but only for a day.
After that, Wales. Where it probably won't snow near the cost. But it'll be
cold and subsequently fun trying to light a fire on a beach. Maybe.

Before all of that happens, I still have work to do. Go me!

Oh, and a Happy Christmas to all :)
