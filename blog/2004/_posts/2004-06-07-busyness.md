I currently have far too much to do. I finished my exams, obviously, and now
have to help put a show on which goes up in 3 days. Therefore, there is much
rehearsalness ocurring and it's eating my life...

Anyway, it's going to be great. There's dancing and everything. Photos will
most likely follow in a few days :)
