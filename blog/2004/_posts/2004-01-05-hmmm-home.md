title: "Hmmm. Home."

I'm now back in Cambridge. The downside is two-fold: firstly, I am no longer
on holiday; secondly, I still think it's yesterday. At the very best about 4pm
yesterday. Ah well. At least it's warm.The flight, as usual, was delayed
because the US government have taken to searching everyone who leaves the
country as well as enters it. This, they seem not to realise, makes no sense.
Still, it means that I got no sleep and landed today at about lunchtime. This
doesn't mean that I got lunch though, oh no, I waited a whole 5 hours until it
was lunchtime in New York, so that it would feel right. Now it's 9pm, and I
have no idea what year it is.I should get on and work.
