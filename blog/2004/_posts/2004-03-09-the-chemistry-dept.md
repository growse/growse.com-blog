title: "The Chemistry Dept."

Just spent 2 and a half hours sat in the chemistry department whilst some
complete idiot spent at least 30 mins per person doing practical marking.
Fortunately I was 4th in a queue that was 24 people long, but despite marking
beginning at 2pm, I didn't get finished until 4. That's 4 people in 2 hours,
with another 20 to go in the remaining hour, on the last day of marking.
Anyway, not only was the marker an idiot, he gave me a crap mark because one
of my starting materials was dodgy and he didn't understand one of the
spectra.

And people ask me why I'm losing complete faith in the department.
