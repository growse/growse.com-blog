Edinburgh station is the most peculiar railway station in Britain. It makes
absolutely no sense, and it should be a river. The platforms are numbered
entirely randomly, so that it's impossible to predict where platform 20 is,
becuase it probably isn't anywhere near platform 19. I'm musing on this
subject because I have about an hour to wait for the next London train, which
will probably be both full and late, and I won't get a seat.

Besides that, the show's finished and made a decent profit despite nasty
reviews, so I'm mildly happy. Photos from here and Amsterdam will be up
shortly. Promise.

The only things I now have left to do in my life is find a house, a job, and
lunch, two of which aren't necessarily easy. Should be interesting trying
though. Bah.

I might busk with my bass.
