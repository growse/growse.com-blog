I've been busy. That's all I can say. I went to Cambridge for a week to do the
same show I went to Edinburgh to do, which was fun, and now I'm back and
working. Same job. Same old.

Housemate-shaped-thing has gone off to Reading for the week so it's just me.
Hurrah for nothing, boo for boredom. Oh well. Food calls.
