title: "Having to put up with life"

Well, for those of you who may or may not know me, I'm back in cam tomorrow
(today). In the continuing saga that is turning out to be "my week off", I
will have spent around Â£30 getting to and from Cambridge to learn that no
matter wherever I am, I still feel shit. Still, it's more peaceful here. The
downside is washing-up. The flip-side to that obviously is eating whatever I
decide I want to. Or whatever's in the fridge, but those two lists usually
coincide and that's definately a good thing.

I haven't yet decided what time I'd like to be there. A whole small fraction
of me wants to be up there in time for brunch, but I can see this distinctly
not happening. The other option is to get there much later, and lounge around
here for a bit. Might even go to the park, provided the weather gets off its
arse and does something approximating average for the time of year.

Must find a black studded dress shirt. Hmmm....
