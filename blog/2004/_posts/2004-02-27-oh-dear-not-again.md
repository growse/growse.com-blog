title: "Oh dear, not again"

It's snowing. Again. The first time round was really cool, the second time was
again, rather nice, but now it's just dull and cold. Pretty though :)I

t's now blizzarding outside my window, and I have to walk to the lab in 10
minutes. Great. IT'S NEARLY MARCH DAMMIT, WE WANT SUNSHINE.

The flipside is that I spend from between 4pm until about 11:30 pm indoors
this evening (in a theatre) as we have the joy of two shows today, and two
shows tomorrow. And I've got a get-in the day after that. And lots of work to
do. Yay!

As I've been writing this, it's stopped snowing. There may be a god after all.
