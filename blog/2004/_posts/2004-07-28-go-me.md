Woah, back in Kent for a whole 2 hours to sort out a mild publicity crisis for
Jazzmatazz. Off back up to London in a bit to carry on rehearsals for this
week, which are going quite well. Have to be up at 3:30 on Sunday morning to
catch the early flight up to Edinburgh though, which won't exactly be fun.

It's warm. London's pretty. I miss the chocolate.
