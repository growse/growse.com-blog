title: "It's not snowing"
---
Well, only a week until Christmas now, and it's not even snowing. I'm informed
that cities keep warmer than other places (like the north), and so it'll
possibly never snow here. But that's not relevant, because I'm up north in a
few days, with the snow :)

It is rather cold though, and I still have to buy people chocolate, and other
such nice things.
