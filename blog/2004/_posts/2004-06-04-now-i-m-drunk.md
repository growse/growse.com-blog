title: "Now I'm drunk."

Well, I'm no actually. Which is hard to believe. Take today, I finished all my
exams. It's now 22:08, and I've not had a single drink. Not one. I've been
rehearsing you see, and I've got to be up tomorrow at 8.

I got 68.7% in a fifth of my part II as well. The courseworky bit, which isn't
that bad I suppose. :)
