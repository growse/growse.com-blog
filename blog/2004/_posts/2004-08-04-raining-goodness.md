I must say that Edinburgh is rather a nice place. The entire concept of
putting a castle on a hill, building a huge train station next to it, and then
trying to fit all the other usual town stuff (shops, roads etc.) around it on
not-exactly-level ground is quite an amusing one. It's not exactly very warm,
but that's good, because that means more people come and see our show.

If you're in Edinburgh at the moment, you want to be going to C venues at
about 2:50 on any day of the week between now and September. We're in the -1
venue (basement) and will try not to take very much money off you.

The flat I'm in with about 5 other people is rather nice, quite large and
everything in the kitchen works. Problem is that it's on the 3rd floor, which
is a pain for getting stuff up the stairs. That said, the views are quite
good.

As far as the show itself is going, we open in about 2 hours. After flying to
Scotland at a stupidly early time, we arrived to do a tech rehearsal at
midday. With a timeslot of 4 hours, and a charge of Â£10 for every minute we
went over, I came to the rapid conclusion that the tech would be a bit
inadequate. As it turned out, we didn't get everything done that we needed to,
and so the dress rehearsal (yesterday) was a bit shambolic. Still, today
should be interesting.

Add to that I'm on holiday (again!!!) in a few days :)
