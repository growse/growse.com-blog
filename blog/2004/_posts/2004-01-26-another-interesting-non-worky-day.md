title: "Another interesting non-worky day"
---
I got up at 8:30. I was in a theatre (a cold theatre at that) by 9am. I was
there until about 4, at which point I went to see a doctor who told me I was
ill. I then went back to the theatre. I left the theatre at 9:30pm, and now I
have to work. I envisage working until about 2am, at which point I will sleep
until 9am again, as I have a lecture at 10am.The scary thing is, I really like
doing this. :)
