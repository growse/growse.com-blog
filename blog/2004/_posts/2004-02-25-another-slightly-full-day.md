title: "Another slightly full day"

Just had the opening night of Little Shop of Horrors. Therefore I decided to
put up the pictures I took yesterday, in the tech. It went rather well,
except for one bit which involved a virutal techie huddle, followed by that
particular problem solving itself.

At least I don't have to be up tomorrow.
