Just had the opening night of Little Shop of Horrors. Therefore I decided to
put up the [pictures I took yesterday, in the tech][1]. It went rather well,
except for one bit which involved a virutal techie huddle, followed by that
particular problem solving itself.

At least I don't have to be up tomorrow.
