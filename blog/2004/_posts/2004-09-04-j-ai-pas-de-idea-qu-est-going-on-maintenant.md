I went to France. I can't quite explain why, because I'm not sure myself. All
I do remember is building a kitchen for a bit, and the weather being rather
hot.

So I apologise for going to France, it was minorly unforeseen, and I'll try to
not do it again in the future.

So now I'm in Canterbury. Again, apologies. I have to see a bank manager again
on Monday and explain to him that me not being a student any more doesn't
magically mean I can now afford lots of stuff - I've still got no money, just
like any other student. At some point I need a house and a job as well.

Woe.
