Well, today was an interesting day. As was yesterday. As, I fear, tomorrow
will be. I was up at 8 yesterday, 7:30 today, 8 tomorrow, and possibly 8 on
tuesday. This is just unreasonable given I'm a student, but it's the price I
pay for working on a huge production. Get-in was today, which only took 15
hours or so. Tomorrow is another 15 hours of the tech, followed by the dress
and opening night the following day. Yay!
