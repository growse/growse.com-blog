I'm doing 4 exams, I've done two, and they had exactly the same seating plan.
I'm at desk number 13, into which you can read what you like.

It never happened to me until just now - got into an exam to find that two of
the questions were about stuff that I knew about!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wrote a
whole 6 sides on something, and countered that with a neat side and a half on
a question I didn't know anything about. They're going to love me :)
