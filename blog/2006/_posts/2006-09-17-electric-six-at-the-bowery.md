title: "Electric Six at the Bowery"
---
Well, last night was interesting - I knew that [Electric Six][1] had just
started a US tour and their night in NY was last night, at the [Bowery
Ballroom][2].

It didn't really start off well when I went to the ATM to get cash. An amnesia
fit meant that I managed to block my card, thus leaving me without any ability
to get cash. No cash = no taxi to venue. After a subsequent spate of lateral
thinking, I managed to make use of a phone and a credit card to get what I
needed. After that, things went well. The venue was tiny, about half the size
of anything I'd been to before - which meant that the keen people (like me)
actually got to lean on the stage. No crowd control and no silly European
noise restrictions = good gig. They even let me play some notes at the end (it
got quite silly). Not sure if that counts as fulfilling my ambition to play
bass loudly on a stage somewhere somehow before I'm 40. Probably not....

It's 11:30, and I just got up. Sundays are a wonderful thing :-)
