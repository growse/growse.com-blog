Little design tweak this time. Still a little bit more work to do on this, so
it can be considered a beta.

I'm hearing all sorts of mumblings from across the pond that it's actually
quite warm in London. Numbers such as "38" and "105" keep floating over and
it's actually making me quite happy. If I were back in the UK, it would be
really really hot and I would be surrounded by people moaning about the stupid
weather and how it never is that nice warm temperature with a cool sea breeze.
Here, in NY, it's 35 degrees almost every day, and yet the people don't moan
and the air conditioning is awesome. That said, instead of being surrounded by
moaning brits, I'm surrounded by americans, but everything's got it's
downside.

I've yet to do anything truely exciting here. Last weekend I went on the
Statten Island ferry to discover that there doesn't seem to be anything
interesting on Statten Island. I really should do something like go to the
beach, or catch the bus to DC, or go and see Boston. Maybe even the Niagra
Falls, although that's a 7 hour train journey...
