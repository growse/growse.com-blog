title: "Picsie, reborn!"
---
Well, progress is definately being made. I invented the concept of Picsie a
while back during my failed quest to find a decent photo-storage-management
system. Now that I've got my own server and oodles of space to play with, I
decided to revive the project after I killed it. I can't quite remember why I
killed it - usually I have a very good reason for killing projects which I
then handily forget. I then attempt to bring the project back to life before
discovering why I killed it in the first place.

Anyway, I'll put some blurb up on the projects page, and eventually let people
download the code :) In the meantime, I'll be redirecting my photos page to
[Picsie][1].
