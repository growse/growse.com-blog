Well, I bought a lens. I umm'd and arr'd and err'd and then finally decided to
get a [Sigma 24-70 ex dg macro][1]. People have raved about it's quality and
the fact that it's a good price and f2.8 across the whole focal range made it
a must-buy. Only downsides are that it's big, heavy and doesn't focus as fast
as the canon USM lenses. Which doesn't really bother me at all.

Yay!

Better photos in the photo section to follow :-)
