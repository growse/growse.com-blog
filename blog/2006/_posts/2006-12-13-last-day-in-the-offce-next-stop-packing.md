title: "Last day in the offce. Next stop, packing."

The time is here. It's my last day in the office for my overseas placement. I
know it's a Wednesday, but I threw caution to the wind and wore jeans as
though it were a friday. I like to live dangerously :) I might even get a
chocolate brownie at lunch, a mild celebration of spending 184 days in the US.
It's 184, because if I spend 185 days here, the UK government remove my
residency status in the UK, despite the fact that I'm renting a flat I'm not
living in over there.

So now I'm sitting here with a lot of paperwork that needs to be mailed/given
to different people at different times, half of which I don't have the right
address for. Still, it's only customs/tax paperwork. Not like that's
important.

So tomorrow, I'm finishing all my packing and then some nice people are
turning up on Friday to put it on a plane for me. I probably won't see it
again until 2007, but I'm not too bothered about that. Not sure what I'm going
to do with myself after everything's been packed. I'll do my usual going to
the airport 6 hours early to eat the free food thing on Saturday, but it's not
going to be that interesting. I hope it storms, or something.

[I saw this on Slashdot][1] and whilst it's not a 100% original idea, it
brightened my day :)
