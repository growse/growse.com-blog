I've been faffing with secondary DNS. After perusing the reports at
[DNSStuff][1], I realised that there were a few problems with the current DNS
implementation. Of course, misconfigured DNS is baaaaaaad as it helps nasty
people to do DoS attacks. I think. Anyways, I found [EveryDNS][2] who provide
secondary DNS hosting for free, so I've gone with them. Reliability and
cheapness :)

In other, less geeky, news, I'm getting slightly concerned about coming home.
I've got a whole bunch of stuff that gets packed up by a nice company and
carted off to my house in London, making a brief stop in customs along the
way. The problem is that I'm flying back in 2 weeks and no-one's done anything
about organising the shipping of my stuff. Also, I'm not living at the same
address in London that I was when I moved my stuff here. In further addition
on-top-of-that, I'm not going to be at that address for most of December. I
can see this one getting quite screwed up.

Anyways, everything here is wonderfully cold, just like it should be in winter
:)
