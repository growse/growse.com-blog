title: "What I did yesterday"
---
As I'm sure everyone knows, I'm [going to Sri Lanka][1] at the end of April.
Yesterday, everyone who's going decided to have a collection day in Canary
Wharf. The idea was simple: we'll put an exercise bike in the middle of one of
the plazas, start at 8am, bike in 1 hour shifts, and say we're cycling across
Sri Lanka (about 140 miles, 224 km) in 10 hours. Meanwhile, other people can
collect.

After turning up at 8am, we were proceeded to be rained on lots, and ignored
by the vast majority of the suits swarming out of the Canary Wharf tube
station. The idea was that after 9am, we'd run in shifts of collectors, so
that the rest of us could go and get some work done. Thankfully, we were
eventually publicised by the company's own internal publicity thing using this
amazing photo (I'm second from left):

(Ok, I lost this photo. Don't tell anyone)

After that, we started to collect a bit more. I was collecting 11-12 and then
cycling from 12-1pm during which time I managed to cover a stonking 28km
which, it turns out, was slightly above-average for the day (not as much as
40km guy, grrrrrrrrrrrr). I was, of course, delighted that it was sunny for
the whole day, except for the bits where I was collecting and cycling, when it
rained. Hard.

In any case, we actually hit the magic 224km with about 20 mins to go so got a
total of 232km. Also, it turns out we raised Â£595.01, which means it was all
worthwhile :)
