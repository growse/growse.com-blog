Well, I promised and failed to give an entry from the airport, but that's
mainly because loads of people turned up, and we got drunk-ish at about 10am.
Then there was all the champagne on the plane, so that counted out being
sane/sober when I landed and so I've had to leave until now. Now being the
morning when I had a 6am meeting which was then cancelled. Grrrrrrrr.

It's looking decidedly miserable outside from my view on the 25th floor of the
Hilton so I might just sit here and do some work instead of walking the 100
yards to the office and doing it there.

Ho Hum.
