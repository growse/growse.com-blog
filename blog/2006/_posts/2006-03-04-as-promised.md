Well, I promised a post from a 1st class lounge, and here it is. I'm in JFK,
and the flight leaves at half 9 (in about an hour) and there's not a lot to
do. It's rather pleasant in here and the food was fabulous.

All in all, rather a good week. But then again, any week that involves an
evening containing $65 rounds of drinks, a large amount of steak, a guy with 3
titanium black amex cards and a casual invite to the Monaco grand prix is
going to be a good one.

Ski time next!
