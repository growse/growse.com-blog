Really. I'm not. I've just not had anything interesting to report of late. I
had a very pleasant weekend, and caught the boat from Greenwich to Westminster
as part of a leasurely day into town. Took about an hour, but was lovely.

Work-wise - I'm turning a blog into a forum. This, technically, is easy, but
presents a whole bunch of problems in terms of security and letting people do
things. So I'm having to figure out this whole permissioning thing in my head,
which in a way is probably good for me in the long run.

The company is interviewing the technical grads for next year this week, so
I'll hopefully be along to them to sit on "the other side" of the interviews
and weigh in my opinion on who they should hire. It'll be fun :-)
