title: "Conspiracy Theorists - A true social phenomenon"
---
(I posted this recently on a forum and thought I would replicate here)

Conspiracy theorists usually feel a need to differentiate themselves from the
mainstream by holding opinions that contradicts "official" explanations,
mostly because they think it's fashionable to be seen to be "not a sheep".
Also could be taking a gamble on the prospect that when the "truth" is finally
revealed, they can look smarter compared to the masses.

Commonly seen to be endlessly watching or making "documentaries" and
absorbing, sheep-like, every detail that could possibly provide an explanation
as to why the "official" explanation is wrong. Most arguments hinge either
around flawed science, or the reasoning that because something isn't fully
explained to their satisfaction, everything else is lies.

Sadly, it's never going to stop being "fashionable" for these people to feel
like they're on the inside of a big secret. The shallowness of conspiracy
theorists is demonstrated as they question everything simply in order to gain
perceived status within their audience as someone who "thinks differently",
"is his(her) own person", "doesn't take crap from governments". They believe
such qualities allows them to get laid sooner, and with more people.

Unfortunately, in most cases, the glaring lack of logic and reason only makes
them appear to be closed-minded geeks trying to cling onto some sort of
individualism to make themselves seem important. It's sad, but it's true.
