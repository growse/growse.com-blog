I'm off to the US. Again. Tomorrow.

I literally just checked in and printed my boarding pass for a flight that
leaves tomorrow at about half one (I love [BA][1]), and I now need to pack
everything in a bag small enough to take on a plane. Usually, this isn't a
problem as the luggage allowance for business class people is fairly generous,
but this time there's an added complication. About 7 hours after I land from
New York, I'm flying to Geneva to go skiing. Therefore, I need three sets of
clothes: NY-only clothes, skiing-only clothes, and clothes that fall into both
categories. So I put the skiing-only clothes in a big which is now not far
from Heathrow, and I'm going to have to pack NY and NY/skiing clothes in a bag
which is small enough to take on the plane. This bag also needs to be big
enough to fit all the skiing clothes in, as I'm going to do some sort of
clever luggage/changeover/shifting/bag-swapping thing in the small amount of
time I'm spending in the UK over the next 2 weeks. Still, packing is one of
those things I'm quite good at, if you measure against how quickly I can do it
in along with how stressed I get about it (10 mins, not very).

There will of course be lots of photos in about 2 weeks.

Next post here will probably be from the 1st class lounge at Heathrow terminal
4. :-)
