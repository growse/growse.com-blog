title: "My Bonus!"

We have this thing at work whereby a certain percentage of the profits are
shared out amongst the employees. So the idea is the company hits a target
profit amount, and then everyone starts to get money. It's something like 1%
of the total amount.

So mine turned up today, and seeing as I've only technically been working
there for 3 months it had to be scaled down. That said, I've now got £87.29
(gross, £50 ish net) to play with!

Time to buy some cake.
