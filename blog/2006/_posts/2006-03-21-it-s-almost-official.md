I've been trying to put into place the various bits and pieces for my next
work placement over the past few days. It seems that there's a certain order I
have to do things in so that everyone stays happy, and the end result is that
I get to go live in New York for 6 months. It's likely to be something
approaching the media area, but I'm not 100% sure yet. Decision about that on
Wednesday. :-)

All I need now is a visa and a place to live, and I'm sorted. Well, that and I
need to wrap everything up that I've been doing over the past 6 months to
leave it in a state whereby someone else can pick it up and fix it if it
breaks....
