title: "Little changes, here and there"
---
I'm making a few changes to the site here and there. Just little things, like
making the news url's nicer (thank god for mod_rewrite). I've also put a spam
filter on the comments which uses [Akismet][1]. If you get any false negatives
when trying to write a comment, drop me a mail at "you told me that i am a
spammer at growse dot com". The mail address is obviously obscurfated to
defeat those pesky spammers, but if you replace the relevant words with
symbols and spaces with something like a "_", then you'll be fine.

I thought about going with [KittenAuth][2], but Akismet is more transparent.
If it proves problematic, then I'll switch.

Other changes are more randomness on the front page and the creation of a
[Projects][3] page. This is still being put together, but I've started a few
development projects recently and will be putting those details up on that
page. I ditched the about page, as it was a bit pointless. Things I still have
to put in is RSS and possibly some sort of breadcrumb, but we'll see about
those.
