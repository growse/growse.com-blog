Apparently there was a major hardware failure on the box which this site is
hosted, and so a backup has been restored. However, as a result, a blog entry
and 3 comments have been lost. Apologies to all. If it's any consolation, my
email doesn't work either.

Feel free to leave comments again - hopefully it won't lose them again. Also,
I'm told that the hardware is about 10x faster now, so everything should be
more lovely than before. :-)
