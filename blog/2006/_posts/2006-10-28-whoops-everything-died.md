title: "Whoops. Everything died."
---
A strange thing happened. The hard disk in the server died. There I was, all
playing around with stuff late at night and then I noticed that I couldn't
write to disk any more. Kept on saying that the root filesystem was mounted
read-only. Thinking that this was a strange thing indeed, I looked in the logs
to find lots of errors of everything dying.

Anyway, I rescued what I could, and now we're back up and running with a new
one. I did however lose the last two blog posts. Boo. Can't be arsed to repeat
them.

With that all said and done, I might go out into the rain.
