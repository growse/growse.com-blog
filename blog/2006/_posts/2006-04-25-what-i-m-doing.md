title: "What I'm doing"
---
Just to let the world (+dog) know what I'm doing, I'm in Sri Lanka like I said
I would be. We arrived on Sunday morning and it's been quite hard work since
then. I'm doing a proper diary thing and I should be able to put it up in the
misc section after I get back. Until then, I'm going back to 40 degree heat in
100% humidity :-)
