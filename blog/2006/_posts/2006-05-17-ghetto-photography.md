Well, a little while back I bought a cheap lens off ebay for about £20. It's a
canon 35-80mm USM. Reason was, I heard that you could take the front element
(glass bit) off it, and it turns into a good macro lens. I imagine all lenses
do this, but if I broke a £20 lens, I don't really care.

Anyway. Wow!

In other news, my Sri Lanka diary is up, get it [here][1].
