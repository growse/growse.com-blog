Well, I'm at that point on a wednesday evening where I'm not quite sure who I
am, whether I'm hungry or not, or what the hell is going on anyway. I think I
need a holiday.It turns out that the 1B natural sciences course here is
actually marginally better orginised than the 1A course, in the sense that I
get fewer lectures. But more practicals. But practicals are fun :)

Anyhow. I've decided to buy a monitor as this one is crap. Basically.
Hopefully, 17" of tft should turn up tomorrow, which is good.

Also, [the saga continues...][1]
