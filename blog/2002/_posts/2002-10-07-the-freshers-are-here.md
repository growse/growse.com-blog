Well, it's that time of year again. College is full of students wondering
round looking embarrassed (sp?) whilst their parents stand next to them saying
"you will do your washing now." and it's all rather amusing. Still, it means I
get to be a task 'setter' on the pub crawl tonight. And I get lots of money
the day after tomorrow. Mmmmmm, Student loan...
