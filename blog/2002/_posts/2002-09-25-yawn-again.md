title: "Yawn. again."

I've got so much to do and I can't really be bothered to do any of it. Organ
scholarship trials start tomorrow and I'll turn up to help intimidate all the
people applying :) Add to that the fact I have to audition a choir in the next
two weeks and make a music list based on not very much past musical experience
means... I'm bored and playing google-whacking again. Best score yet is
374664000 with "establishmentarianism coaxial".

Damn I'm bored. And hungry. Lunch. Chocolate. Mmmmmmm...
