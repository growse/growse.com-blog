title: "18 hours sleep... mmmmm......."

Due to various circumstances (work, socialising etc.) I got little sleep the
night before last. Although this made me the most alert person in the 9am
lecture on saterday, it did mean I had difficulty distinguishing 'today' from
'yesterday' and 'the day before'. The upshot is that I woke up an hour ago
from 18 hours sleep :)
