Well, I had a few initial teething problems with my new computer, mainly that
the 12V line on the psu would go rather mental when any load was put on.
Soooooo..... I got a new one. For the same price that I've just sold the old
one for. It's gold-coloured and rather pretty and everything works fine now :)

I managed to get to 3 GHz earlier, but it wasn't very stable. I think it needs
more volts...

/me wonders off with the soldering iron and the resistors...
