New monitor arrived this morning. The AOC LM720A. Hang on, there's a picture
somewhere....

I might swap it for another as there is a dead pixel in the middle of the
screen as well as another one near the top. Apparently AOC will replace it.
We'll see....

Weather's gone all funny as well. We had about 80mph winds here on Sunday,
which nearly smashed a few windows around here. And I've run out of food, so
need some more. Lots more, in fact. And before I forget, my replacement cold
cathode arrives tomorrow :) I really should send the other one back when I get
a free moment - things which are rare right now. :(
