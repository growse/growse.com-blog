title: "When things work better than expected."

Since my [last post][1], I've been running a slightly experimental spam
filter. The idea being to stop most spam before it gets to spamassassin, which
is relatively expensive to run (in terms of resources).

It's been far too effective. As can be seen on [SpamWatch][2], processed spam
has basically dropped to zero. It's so idle, it's given up reporting
altogether.

Don't panic, because I'm currently devising a brand new way of generating
pretty graphs out of the vast array of data generated by millions of malware-
infested Windows XP desktops which repeatedly attempt to connect to my
mailserver in the hope that they might actually put some gibberish in front of
my face that may entice me into spending some money on Viagra. I've a plan!
