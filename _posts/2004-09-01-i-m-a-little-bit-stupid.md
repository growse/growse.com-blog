title: "I'm a little bit stupid"
---
It was entirely my fault I admit, and I've been doing this sort of thing too
much recently. After getting off the 3pm Scottish Pullman from Edinburgh to
London, I wandered down the platform to get all my stuff out of the luggage
van. There was a _lot_ of stuff. 2 bags, computer monitor, bass amp, and
basses. Naturally, being the idiot I am, I left the most valuable thing (the
bass case) to one side and walked off without it. That's £450 worth of basses,
a nice £35 case, and the legendary [Blob Blox][1] that were just left sitting
there. Thankfully, the surprisingly nice and clever people at King's Cross
made sure no-one walked off with it, and they've got it.

So now I have to go to London to pick it up. Grrrrrrrrrrrrr............
