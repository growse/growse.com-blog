title: "Abandonment of resolutions"
---
Last year, I made [some new year's resolutions]({% post_url /2011/2011-01-16-some-kind-of-new-thing-for-the-new-year-and-all-that %}) in which I decided that I would get certain things done during the year.

Some of these, I managed to do, mostly through inevitability (see, buying a house), or through actually trying (porting this site to Django). Many I didn't do at all. But there's good reasons for all of these (I count 'laziness' as a good reason).

Given all this, I've decided to do the exact opposite this year and have no resolutions at all. I resolve to do nothing specific. If I achieve great things, like world peace, or a new Django middleware module, then so be it. But I'm not promising anything.
