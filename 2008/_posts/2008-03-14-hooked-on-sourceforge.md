title: "Hooked on Sourceforge"
---
I've gone and put [PSPlant][1] on [Sourceforge][2] over [here][3]. This seems
to be the start of a new phase of my work whereby I take everything that I
create, however useless, and start a Sourceforge project for it. I started
with [Feedling][4], soon I'll start selling old clothes and stuff on it.

In other news, not a lot's going on. Work's busy, and I get to graduate again
on the 29th! Going to be very exciting. Going to pick up some Chelsea buns
from [Fitzbillies][5] - should make me suitably popular in the office. :)
